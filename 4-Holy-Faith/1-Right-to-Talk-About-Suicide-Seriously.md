## Right to Talk about Suicide Seriously

Most people seriously considering suicide can't talk about it, not unless they bury the very-conscious awareness of the standard medical policy of hospitalization and drugging. The more seriously somebody genuinely needs to talk about their depression amid a genuine imminent plan, the less they standardly can without risking the security of their plan. Suicide is legal in New York State, but so are coerced hospitalizations and drugging, threatening people into withholding communicating the severity of their suffering. 

These coercive medical practices are bad.

By the literal meaning of the words, I don't think "Right To Die" is "Right For Physician To Commit Physician-Assisted Suicide." Just in the literal sense, where "right" does not mean "accessibility," the two phrases are different: 
- One permits a person to take actions towards suicide, including talking to a therapist about those actions, without coercion (e.g., hospitalization, drugging, intervention), and without punishment.
- The other gives doctors permission to assist with the suicide.

"Right To Die," by my way more literal interpretation, only changes one item from the current legality in New York: gets rid of involuntary institutionalization and coerced chemicals for planning to commit suicide, so that somebody planning to commit suicide, but not wanting the security of their plan ruined, can get therapy, and not just through philosophy and art.

Here is my favorite Shakespeare sonnet: 

> ### $\Huge &#8220;$
> &ensp;&ensp; *Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,*</br>
> &ensp;&ensp; *As to behold desert a beggar born,*</br>
> &ensp;&ensp; *And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,*</br>
> &ensp;&ensp; *And purest faith unhappily forsworn,*</br>
> &ensp;&ensp; *And gilded honour shamefully misplac'd,*</br>
> &ensp;&ensp; *And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,*</br>
> &ensp;&ensp; *And right perfection wrongfully disgrac'd,*</br>
> &ensp;&ensp; *And strength by limping sway disabled,*</br>
> &ensp;&ensp; *And art made tongue-tied by authority,*</br>
> &ensp;&ensp; *And folly, doctor-like, controlling skill,*</br>
> &ensp;&ensp; *And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,*</br>
> &ensp;&ensp; *And captive good attending captain ill.*</br>
> &ensp;&ensp; *Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,*</br>
> &ensp;&ensp; *Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.*
> ### $\Huge &#8221;$
>
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; - Sonnet 66, Shakespeare.

> [!NOTE]
> ### Academia & Medicine
> 
> The relevance of "Art made tongue-tied by authority and folly, doctor-like controlling skill" is impossible to communicate. It's no coincidence that "doctor-like" is the simile Shakespeare turned to, as that is the perfect description of the kind of authority he refers to, which governs, not just Chenliang's group, but most of the university, academia, and — most un-medically — medicine. 
>   
> My intuitive ideas, way ahead of their time, were often preemptively dismissed and disregarded, until I found the right phrasing and pictures for the faculty to teach and convince them, like the use of rewards from past actions to inform new actions in similar states, similarity as measurable by geometrical (Pythagorean) distance between datapoints or representations, decomposing datapoints into parts and relations, or efficient relational reasoning by prioritizing information relative to those parts. "Simple truth miscall'd simplicity."
>
> I proposed these fundamental insights, and what methods would correspond to them, while they were still original or before they had wider-spread appreciation:
>
> - (a) An agent "choosing" actions at first randomly in an environment, given "states" as input, remembering the actions chosen in a memory together with each state; then in future states, looking at those past actions, in memory, that corresponded to the most similar states to the current state, and taking the ones that got the highest environment rewards in the past, or, with some probability, exploring via taking random actions to get more state-action memory
>    - (relevant method examples: such as via K-nearest neighbors; model-free episodic control; neural episodic control; fully-parametrically, as hypothesized methods of reasoning, rather than symbolically, in RNNs or Decision Transformers),
> - (b) "similarity" as measurable by geometric distance between those numbers ("states") that represent input datapoints
>    - (relevant method examples: such as via Euclidean distance, cosine distance, parametric distance),
> - (c) decomposing those representations into representations of parts and relations
>   - (relevant method examples: such as via segmentation, parameter re-use inductive biases in neural networks like convolution, recurrence, attention, vector-quantization; or, more elementarily, weighted sums with non-linearities),
> - (d) efficient relational reasoning by prioritizing information for each part relative to each other part
>   - (relevant method examples: such as via MHDPA on vectors),
> - (e) representing each part with numbers that don't vary much for that part unless there are meaningful contextual changes
>   - (relevant method examples: such as with parameter re-use inductive biases in neural networks like convolution, recurrence, attention, vector-quantization; or gating; or frozen parameters of trained or symbolically-programmed encoders),
> - (f) training multiple such wisdoms in parallel to vote across each other and create a more general diversity
>   - (relevant method examples: such as via ensembling, evolutionary populations, and, more elementarily, mini-batches), and
> - (g) representing concepts more generally by learning across far more varied domains
>   - (relevant method examples: GATO).
>
> Each, individually or grouped, were dismissed by the faculty when they were still essentially mine (not always, but at least as the field of deep learning progressed, slowly), as I was repeatedly gaslit by my faculty listeners, with their authoritative rejection or suspicion, into doubting or tripping over my own far better understanding, as I tailored everything carefully to their understanding into symbolic methods or symbolic-neural hybrids, since most of them, initially, were skeptical of pure deep learning or thought deep learning was a fad.
>
> They are a really conservative and vampiric research department. What makes them conservative? They don’t come up with anything original or new (by the standards of a deep understanding of the kind of incremental work they do and when they do it). What makes them vampiric? They make incremental modifications to existing works or within existing research-area zeitgeists that have no profound or moral point in the sense of actual principle rooted in unsuperficial caring of others.
>
> The CS department's faculty, with occasional exception, didn't hear anything that they didn't want to, that they hadn't already internalized for multiple decades during their careers, that they weren't already clinically versed on, taught to them through their studies, normalized by their colleagues, and standardized, discussing "needy nothing trimm'd in jollity" while my ideas were "miscall'd simplicity" until they became mainstream, with credit for my teaching then "unhappily forsworn."
>
> As well as just simple intuitions that were pedagogically better:
> - (a) Backprop as just an algorithm for taking a derivative, wherein the change that would hypothetically increase or decrease a function is disseminated, operation by operation, from the output back to the input, to each parameter in that function,
> - (b) [LSTMs as biological neurons](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i5hS2iDVuo24PnGicvn5dIZYXUzDfPAl/view?usp=share_link), and
> - (c) ["Convolution is all you need"](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Conv-is-all-you-need.md).
>   - The fundamental method for relational reasoning in big AI systems shouldn't be referencing a Shakespeare tone-deaf association like "You just want attention" (the paper is called "Attention is all you need," and introduces a relational reasoning method) when a much [better analogy to relationships exists (all you need is love)](../2-Opposing-Views/7-PhD-Faculty-Malpractices.md#relationships), or the literal version: "The Attention Mechanism as We Propose it Can Be Useful for Everything Deep Learning Is Used for Today." "Relationships are all you need" would do, so as not to make a title "fun" (but like not even) arbitrarily. My idea and implementation for ECCV, 2022 was called ["Relation is all you need"](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms-V3-in-progress/blob/main/2-Opposing-Views/7-PhD-Faculty-Malpractices.md#relationships) for that purpose, but "All you need is love" would honestly be the bravest "fun" title, if you can hear that, if you can hear the connotation and subtext in words, such as in a poetry sense. For such a fundamental method, it's important. The *it*. It's important. There is a Dao to language.
>   - ["Convolution is all you need"](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Conv-is-all-you-need.md) is okay because it's a valid insult. Much of the field convolutes things to keep methods cryptic, er, let's say by accident. The target is different. Punching up is fairer sport (art) than punching down.
>
> And many more general concepts:
> - (a) Randomness and diversity to escape local or "instantaneous" search limitations (local optima, myopia, e.g. myopic derivatives, and the process of searching/data-acquisition),
> - (b) gradients as directions of most increase, whose finger can point both opposite less error or forward towards more reward, the latter especially when differentiating an actor through a good differentiable predictor, or predictors, of immediate and any future outcomes, where "good" depends on the quality and quantity (perhaps prioritized for efficiency and exploration-sake) of memory/data learned-from and the outcome-goal(s),
> - (c) curriculum learning as prioritized experience replay, where data that there is most to learn from is prioritized for learning,
> - (d) learning rate schedules as exploration/exploitation tradeoffs,
> - (e) parameter-reuse methods for invariability and greater training diversity,
> - (f) training stability via incremental progress, as in small gradient steps, additive updates layer-wise, or diffusion, except not necessarily temporally, and
> - (g) [more advanced math](https://github.com/slerman12/Teaching/blob/master/Other%20materials/Integrals.md) usually pertaining to calculus (non-instantaneity, bi-directionality, cross-derivatives).
>
> I worked under Chenliang and the university's arbitrations as "captive good attending to captain evil," hard work, brilliance, love, and art crushed with interrogations, urgency, and criteria based on ridiculous standards where the quality of the work meant much less than how deeply in the weeds students went (away from any fundamental principles/insights) to claim "state of the art" in time for the latest conference deadline.
> <!--- I achieved both repeatedly though. For example, my original MHDPA innovation paper in 2018 had to be an end-of-semester "project."--><!--," and in a semester when I took other classes, and had to apply for the NSF GRFP (which I got a rare and esteemed ["honorable mention" for](https://anon.cs.rochester.edu/news-events/news/archive/2019/2019-04-10_lermannsf.html) with [excellent reviews](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87ef2c97-c1d5-4333-9247-a0d28a689efb)), and had my first psychosis, finishing the paper's submission-ready experiments in the hospital. Through unappreciated efforts that were side-tracked into less relevance.-->
> 
> "And strength by limping sway disabled," as I limp, literally, to walk, from the eczema on my legs, as caused throughout my PhD by unecessarily imposed anxiety, and limp in my words, trying through repeated disappointing edits to describe the faith forsworn and right perfection disgrace'd while I was coerced, administered ("treated") (with hair loss, benzo gargling, abusive clinical disregard, more repeated hair losses, and more), and worked there (discouraged, exploited, prototypes literally stolen, advisors and committee members leaving, doing more work on demand of advisors and committee members than any other human would, being terminated, etc.).
>
> ### Love & Loneliness
>
> My mom told me the Russian translation of this sonnet translates the last line to mean, that there is somebody in the narrator's life, for him, for whom he still has reason to live.
>
> <p align='center'>"Tired with all these, from these would I be gone, save that, to die, I leave my love alone."</p>
>
> And that might be the interpretation, but I hear in Shakespeare's words that that's not the one he necessarily meant. My interpretation might end up even more controversial than this chapter of this book, really, since a lot of people perhaps want to interpret a romantic notion at the end (my mom knows Shakespeare didn't mean "my love" maternally). In my opinion, "my love" would be a pretty big thematic divergence and betrayal, if after every line (from "purest faith unhappily forsworn," to "maiden virtue rudely strumpeted," to "gilded honour shamefully misplac'd"), Shakespeare's meaning coalesced to, "Well, I could never do that to my girlfriend." Not to man-splain what Shakespeare meant ($\text{\color{green}"sam-splaining" is a distinct form}$), but this is what I think Shakespeare meant:
>
> The narrator referred to himself as a "beggar born," and he cries for death so as to behold himself "desert" from himself, meaning to "leave" himself (to die) and "leave" all of the tragedies listed thereafter. The last line is exactly parallel to this in meaning. He refers to his love: "I leave *my* love" — his literal, un-metaphorical love — "alone." To leave his love is leaving his body. It's leaving his skin. It's leaving his emotion. When a person dies, they don't just leave their life. They leave the constellations of beauty inside them, including all of their love, potentially in lonely isolated unappreciation. One could even interpret, instead of leaving alone, he'd <!--rather--> take you all with him, curse you all, poison the lot of you! (Rather than "alone"). Perhaps the simplest possible interpretation of the word "love" will be called "simplicity" by academics. The un-metaphorical meaning, the literal one — love — is the meaning I think Shakespeare most meant.
>
> This sonnet expresses a tragedy, of someone who has so much love and passion — and it's wasted.
>
> Another interpretation is that his love is tied to a soulmate who he is separated from. I like that interpretation, too, but that would be a fast thematic divergence* from the <!--can get rid of "rest of the" but next line ends up sounding worse-->rest of the sonnet<!--can edit to "'s conveyed theme" but next line then sounds worse-->.
>
> Every other interpretation, besides this literal one, is wrong in some way that I can specify if they're listed. In short, they diverge from the commentary of the sonnet and undermine the narrator's struggle.
>
> *a fast thematic divergence for interpreting from the rest of the sonnet

The only period of my life that didn’t lead to suicide ideation, was when I lived in Drama House, a student theatre living community. Undergrad years weren’t perfect, and I suffered from severe social anxiety, two majors, and eczema, but it was by far the best period of my life and probably the only time in my life I was <!--even a modicum--> socially happy. That was where I first saw Sartre’s play, No Exit, downstairs of my big nice well-decorated-by-me private room. 

> [!NOTE]
> ### Exiting Hell, Unifying Quantum with Einstein, & Symbiotically Transcending Individual Psychological and Behavioral Repression
> 
> Sartre, in his play [No Exit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Exit) (wherein there is no exit door from Hell), described in less words than anybody that "Hell is other people," meaning, Hell — not just suffering, but Hell — comes from the societal relationships or lackthereof that we cannot move through, transcend, or escape. 
>
> Suicide rates are highest among [trans people](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1377568/us-trans-suicide-rate-by-sex/) and [men](https://afsp.org/suicide-statistics/).
> - Navigating emotional realms where you might get perceived as a predator — as traditionally was and perhaps still is one of the main struggles of transitioning — is hard. At the same time, the more emotional realms exist for you, and whatever their means of expression (e.g., dress), where you might be bullied, laughed at ("Lol alright"), or blocked, for having, showing, or experimenting with and exploring those emotions, the harder, as well, sometimes making finding your own identity and sincere expression impossible or involving too much risk to one's personal relationships and life.
>   - Explorations of identity include social relationships, one's own boundaries with respect to the world, altered states of consciousness, drugs, sustained ascetic disciplines, and philosophical or more scientific perspectives.
>     - This isn't meant to be an exhaustive list.
> - Controversial: If an Age of Enlightenment is ever to come (another "Renaissance"), such a time will be marked by when all people are given their identity, gender, and sexual satisfaction, from the very most promiscuous to the utmost jealous to the most romantic beyond reproach, with limits that come from intelligence and a society that is so innocent and loving that Adam and Eve (and Steve) will know how to approach each other’s hearts, by their human nature, uncorrupted by stress and systems of oppression, and when not to.
>   - Sages, monks, shamans, and healers have been exploring identity for many millenia, long before the Woke movement. But the Woke movement gets different credit because, until recently, those explorations were taught to have to be individual. The Woke movement has began the mass-teaching of identity exploration as a collective process, individual and symbiotic processes of realization, evolution, exploration, and responsibility.
>     - I think Woke is a planned precursor to Enlightenment, even though some of it's stupid.
>       - Einstein’s first postulate represents equality ("my physics are your physics, your physics are my physics"), Einstein’s second postulate represents tolerance for the absurd or bizarre or queer or otherworldly ("the speed of light is constant across all reference frames somehow"), and the special theory of relativity represents empathy and being able to transform your views to somebody else’s ("via the Lorentz transformation"). Those were good postulates to culminate in the Woke or Progressive movement of the last century, but Woke, which I think is a precursor for Enlightenment, with flaws, and which perhaps isn't patient with criticism, hasn’t quite filled in all the cracks through which a person can slip, e.g. medical and education systems in particular, which need reform before their faulty metrics start to be optimized with AI, and before the opaqueness of their rule over us — our psychological spheres, collective wisdom, identities, political views, and social understandings — becomes irreversable, which maybe needs its own chapter. The nuances of how those two postulates and theory can backfire are hard to articulate, such as unjust cancellations (I’m even afraid to write this by the way) or free speech (the hypocrisy is severe on both sides for this one). A unified theory integrates each quantum "identity" with both equality-tolerance-empathy and general gravity.
>         - I would disambiguate all this, but then I run the risk of looking like I side with whatever group finds me most naive/offensive right now.
>       - The importance of transcendence of identity can’t be stressed enough. It just needs to be general. My socially anxious self should have (is entitled to) a realistic spiritually significant path to transcending social anxiety, such as experimenting socially, including with darker elements of one's personality, pushing one's own boundaries, not being judged for the process necessarily involved in changing one's own role in established relationship dynamics, practicing different social patterns and levels of inhibition or trust, and practicing approaching strangers. Gender and sexual transcendence are two out of a spectrum of categorical identities (e.g., socially anxious, depressed, schizophrenic, PTSD, love-starved) that people might need transcending. Integrating all of them requires a new theory of physics, as opposed to the standard model that currently dominates the global collective gnosis.
>   - By "transcending," I mean finding what's really there. I don't mean nullifying. If a person has to nullify their emotions, experiences, and impetuses, the best Noble Eightfold Path to do that is to just die, for me.
> - Repression, in a person's actions and expressions, leads to health risks that go beyond just mental.
>   - All the world's a stage, but it's very important that each person can actually play themselves.
>
> A person who wants to commit suicide has "No Exit," because they can't even express truthfully the severity of what they're enduring, as I wasn't with my therapist and wouldn't be able to now.

I talked to my therapist about suicide back in 2022, while I was still allowed to see him. That stopped being the case when the University of Rochester's CS department's health insurance price-hiked each session by hundreds of dollars. I talked to him through completely abstract rhetoric, about suicide. Anything other than abstract philosophical rhetoric, about suicide, would've risked me getting hospitalized coercively and drugged against my will again. I talked to him philosophically, and that's not the kind of serious expression I mean should be safe and possible. I don't mean showing him Shakespeare sonnets or enthusing about radical philosophy. The meanings of those art forms or philosophies, expressed literally and seriously, and in the words that a person has available to them everyday, shouldn't have institutional coercion, including coercive hospitalization and drugging (or random health insurance price hikes<!--, from Aetna, on top of already having co-committed a malpractice against me, t-->), as the threat for their speaking.

"Right To Talk About Suicide Plans Seriously Without Threat Or Risk Of Hospitalization, Drugging, Or Police Action" should be standardized, if serious suicide plans that are planned and intended are to be actually prevented.
- A "free speech" person might argue, "I support free speech, but if somebody talks about an elaborate plan to commit a murder, police should take action, in order to prevent the murder. In order to prevent the murder." But in the case of suicide, the inability to talk about the plan contributes to the likelihood of the suicide.
- "My Body, My Choice" extends to one's body not coercively hospitalized and drugged.
- "Gun rights" people already believe in giving people direct access to a method for suicide.
  - Such methods (or other gruesome ones, that can traumatize literal-witnesses, such as involving locomotives or skyrises), get prioritized, [frequently](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/suicide.htm), over safer, peaceful methods, that require more research ability to learn the methods of and which therapists can't communicate as an alternative to plans that would traumatize other innocent people, the suicide victim lacking any other resort.
- "Right To Die" is distinct from "Right To Talk," but the latter doesn't make sense without the former. Any limitation on the actions a person can take also limits their right to talk about those actions.
- Most of my experience with the medical systems was "physician-assisted suicide."
  - Again, in the literal sense.

Hearing the literal truth of others is needed in order to help them, and that cannot come with strings attached. When it does, those people die, leaving their love alone.
