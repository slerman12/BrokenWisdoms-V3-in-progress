### Embassy Interview

My grandma's sister, "Tsotya" (aunt) Tsilia, and her son, my uncle Sasha, a mathematics professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), were the first to immigrate to America. My grandma, uncle Slava, and mom applied for refugee status to immigrate as well. <!--My grandma, uncle, and mom applied for refugee status to immigrate as well.--> My grandparents and uncle's family were approved, whereas my mom, sister, and I, weren't. So my grandparents and uncle immigrated, and my grandparents sent an invitation to my mom through the embassy. My mom had to fly with us to Moscow, in January, to do an interview at the American Embassy in Moscow to convince them that she was subjugated. <!--My mom had to fly with us to Moscow, in the *freezing cold* of January—she couldn't move her hands in her gloves, they were so numb—to interview at the American Embassy in Moscow to convince them that she was subjugated so she could join her family.-->

"Your form said you have kids. Where are they?"

She had spent the whole day at the embassy, from early morning to night. She said, "I left them with relatives. I cannot bring them here. They would be suffering here. My youngest is 3. It would be torture for them here, without food, without sleep."

Jenya's brother's family lived in Moscow, so my mom was able to leave us with them while she went to the embassy to petition for refugee status.

"A lot of people bring their children here. They think that showing children to us will gain them sympathy, and pity."

"I thought I didn't have to bring them. The documentation said we didn't."

"Yes yes, you're right," the interviewer said. "Why, to America, you're going?"

"I'm going to meet with my family, mom, dad, my brother is already there. I'm the only one left, with my children. My cousin, my brother, everyone is already there. And, second, because there is anti-semitism in Uzbekistan."

"What, in Uzbekistan, you suffered persecution?"

Anti-semitism in Uzbekistan wasn't as bad as in other countries, she told me. In Ukraine, anti-semitism was always worse, from <!--(before and during)--> the war when my grandpa was young, to when my mom was an adult. <!--However, she told me, Jews customarily weren't allowed to hold higher offices in Uzbekistan.-->

"I was at the conservatory. I wanted to study in a PhD program. I couldn't. First, when I was a student, I wanted to continue my studies as a PhD student, but there wasn't a chance for me, because I was Jewish."

She wasn't allowed to do a doctoral, despite having graduated with a diploma with distinction for both college and in the conservatory of music where she earned her master's degree in Music Theory. Her thesis was recommended as the best research paper for publishing, recommended by a woman professor at Moscow Conservatory of Music who came from Russia to listen to the presentations, and my mom submitted it, but it was never published, because "Lerman" is a Jewish name, not Uzbek name.

She continued, "Jewish people don't openly keep their traditions there, they don't get good jobs/positions. I was professor teaching at music college. I had to stop working there last year [in 1998], because they reduced my hours, and not just me, but other Jewish people. Uzbeks they gave many." As a result, my uncle had found her a temporary job for an American firm instead, that had originally been offered to him, where she did indexing, tabulating, and auditing, nothing to do with music theory, despite having been a professor at the music college, respected and always well loved by her students. 

To get refugee status, she had to argue to the interviewer that she deserved refugee status from Uzbekistan, a Muslim country, a Jewish woman <!--with a master's degree--> whose parents and brother already immigrated from Uzbekistan and were already approved by the same consulate for refugee status.
<!--
The interview ended.

### Immigration

Our yard gate in Samarkand was 33 Uzbekistan St., which today we are told by a friend who visited it that it's 27 Uzbekistan St., and by the looks of her photos, the neighborhood is completely, absolutely different from when we lived there.

We flew to NYC for one night, immigrating officially as Jewish refugees, half a year since the embassy interview, then to Rochester, New York after that night. I was 3 and two thirds, and had cried, perhaps foretellingly, on the plane from Uzbekistan. My name, was legally mistranslated to "Semen," later nicknamed by my kindergarten teacher "Sem." My mom (whose name was translated "Nellya") found a low-paying piano teaching job, and hoped to earn more money, so she got another degree, an associate's degree, at Monroe Community College, in Computer Information Systems, again [graduating with distinction](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6183641-3c06-4c82-ba4d-662d0be0dbba). She ended up working multiple jobs, one as a piano teacher giving individual lessons for a piano studio, and another as a part-time computer tutor at the community college where she received her associate's degree in two different labs. My mom's students loved her in America, too. My mom taught me how to program when I took my first-ever computer science class, at the University of Rochester, since the professor wasn't good. In fact, he was really bad. She taught me, through quick intuition, object-oriented programming, and helped me with projects and labs in Java. 

<!--(name removed) who lives in Israel, went to Uzbekistan (Samarkand) and sent a photo, photos of Samarkand, and mentioned the numbers changed because she said she walked by her home, near our yard, where in the photos my mom says it was unrecognizable says it wasn’t ours, but Sima said it was ours. Completely looked different, nothing like our yard, our gate.-->
<!--We immigrated from Uzbekistan St. 27, which at the time was Uzbekistan St. 33-->
<!--But she remembers for sure the house address was 33 Uzbekistan St.-->
<!--My mom found the photos (name removed) sent. From 2018. 27 number.-->
<!--Doesn’t look like it. Completely doesn’t look like it. Absolutely doesn’t look like it. My mom thinks Sin was mistaken. Maybe even a different street.-->
<!--There are photos we have inside the yard behind the gate, and my mom drew a little schematic on a sticky note.-->

7 semesters later, I [graduated](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ea5fb2f-7c92-48e0-87aa-4df7d7eb168c) with two bachelors degrees, in [Computer Science](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fe07066-f9ee-4e49-9016-60481d0d5e07) [and Mathematics](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fe07066-f9ee-4e49-9016-60481d0d5e07). Thanks to work ethic and intelligence, that I inherited from my mom, and some luck, I got into a doctoral program.

Well, thanks also to my doctoral advisor, Henry.

Well, thanks also-also to my best friend, same one I mentioned before. He helped me edit together my statement of purpose and encouraged me as I took and re-took the GRE.

Unlike my mom not being able to in Uzbekistan, I got into the PhD program. I was gonna be a Doctor! I was gonna be the first Doctor of all of my *ancestors*, as far as I knew!

Before accepting me into his doctoral candidacy, Henry connected me to Charles Venuto at the Center for Health and Technology a year into their efforts to model Parkinson's disease (PD) progression. Charles hired me as an undergrad researcher to work with another student, a friend of mine from an on-campus living community, in the UR Medicine Saunders Research Building, where I took on the responsibility of modeling Parkinson's disease for the next several years, including having co-led with that friend the PPMI Data Challenge project, a high-profile data contest hosted by the Michael J. Fox Foundation, which asked, "What factors at baseline predict clinical progression?"

Charles was my Med Center advisor.

<!--Henry recommended me to the position while I was still an undergrad, before the hair loss and benzo brain damage.--> 
Forebodingly, my research under Charles was neurodegenerative modeling. "Neurodegeneration" is when the brain degenerates, for example, due to severe GABA downregulation, as by prolonged chemical floodbaths of GABA from benzodiazepines (as study results have shown: ["current use at baseline was significantly associated with lower total brain volume as well as volumes of the hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus"](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-024-03437-5)).

While I was working and researching under Charles, I had come up with, programmed, run the experiments for, and done most of the writing for the paper/contest-submission for a [disease prognostication machine learning model](https://github.com/slerman12/DiseaseModeling) that won top-three in the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research PPMI  contest, and came up with the idea of building a web app for the prognostication to give clinicians a clean, elegant interface. I had to argue a bit, and convince them, and then they let me, and, as a PhD student (in the early Fall of my third year, already in post-benzo withdrawal), [I even presented it at a conference in DC](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b77731f5-c99a-42f3-a3c2-811cadeb38a2) in front of renowned researchers in the Parkinson's research field. Despite that being my idea and my [prototype](https://github.com/slerman12/DiseaseModelingWebApp), that I had to argue for, build, and present to make credible, all by myself (and in part while in severe withdrawal), they liked it so much that they hired a web development team to build one, didn't put me on that team, and since have never given me credit. Charles also said they were going to patent it having even contacted a patent lawyer, and since have given me no information or updates about that either, or attributions or royalties, or the sum salary of the team they hired to build it, taking it over from me without my permission.

I hope Charles and his colleagues may find the earlier diagram (["5 Computational Neurons"](2-Opposing-Views.md#benzodiazepine-benzos-mechanism-of-action)) valuable in their work, ideally attributing credit. It elucidates original mechanisms of neurodegeneration biologically, computationally, and in psychiatric practice. 

Charles was very supportive as my advisor. He was left-handed. My grandpa was also left-handed. On the website, though, Charles was red-handed.
