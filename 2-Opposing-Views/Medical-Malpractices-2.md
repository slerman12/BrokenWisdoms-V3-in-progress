<!-- <br><i><b>Note:</b> I finished making this diagram just as Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb" started playing on my Spotify, a song about a doctor taking a patient named "Pink"'s soul through "medicines" meant to help him. The next song was "Psycho Killer" which I'll interpret as psychiatric killer. Oh and then "Alabama  Song (Whisky Bar)." Not bad. Any song about alcohol is fitting for the topic of benzos, since they both work by GABA as the mechanism of action. In fact, I introduced a fellow hospital-inmate Sarah to Elliott Smith for the first time with the song "Between the Bars" (about alcohol... not about Xanax bars [Xanax is another benzo and "bars" is the colloquially and sometimes clinically used term for pills of them]) while we were in the hospital (between the bars of confinement). Since she was keeping a synchronicity list while we were there, I think she'll appreciate these observations in this caption when I show her, though it would unfortunately be a non-sequitor to make any claims to their nature or significance. Some of these however are just linguistic.</i> -->

# Part 2

- **University-hospital psychiatrists (two)**
- **University outpatient doctor**

## Psychiatry at the University of Rochester's Strong Hospital

A few months after losing my hair, I was hospitalized, for reasons independent to eczema or the hair loss. *I came in for eczema.* I came into the medical system for eczema. I came into the University of Rochester's medical system that summer 2017. I came in for eczema. I was never hospitalized, yet. I'm $5\text{'}5\text{'' } 110\text{lb}$. 

I had a prescription for benzos before, Xanax, but for eczema and social anxiety, $\text{1/4}$ to $\text{1/2}$ of a milligram to be taken daily or as needed. I took them sometimes during my junior and senior years of college at the University of Rochester, as needed, usually for social anxiety, usually spaced out by more than two weeks, during the time when I took them at all, and they gave me small hangovers/dazes when the effect wore off. Knowing they were in a similar class of drugs to alcohol (see [below](#benzodiazepine-benzos-mechanism-of-action)), I took them conservatively.

I had to stay in the University of Rochester's Strong Hospital for a month and take $48\text{x}$ that dosage, of the comparatively strong-per-duration-per-milligram Ativan, reduced later to $10\text{x}$ that dosage, over the course of $3$ times per day, every day, for that month and more than $5$ months after due to doctor-induced dependence and doctor-dependent tapering scheduling, the details of what was being treated still un-inquired about, incommunicable, and unbeknownst to them, solely derived from the medical record from RGH (see ["My trauma"](#my-trauma) for elaboration on this). Think about that. $\text{1/4}$ to $\text{1/2}$ of a milligram, once every two weeks at most (and usually much more rarely), had side effects. $48\text{x}$ $-$ $10\text{x}$ that dosage, but every day.

Accounting for dosage *and* rate, that's a minimum $336\text{x}$ $-$ $70\text{x}$ &nbsp; to &nbsp; $672\text{x}$ $-$ $140\text{x}$ increase.

Just prior to this, the I Ching had answered to me about the reason for the less-than-ideal consciousness that rules humanity: "Difficulty at the beginning" $\rightarrow$ "Increase." My interpretation: Struggle among people from infancy or childhood, or at the outset of a crisis ("Difficulty at the beginning") $\rightarrow$ (changes to) Perpetual acceleration of interventions, or, more specifically, dependence of an individual, collective, or collective standards and systems on more mechanisms of intervention, rather than pause, substitution, remembrance, reconsideration, or decrease of all of what preceded ("Increase"). Yes, all the I Ching answers specified in this book were/are real. The crisis at the "beginning" can also be interpreted as, for example, one's hair no longer sprouting from one's head, or further yet back to simply eczema. <!--Maybe comment out this last sentence-->

For the first three or so weeks, I was really, really drunk/high. Then the fog rolled in. The chemical waterboarding was taking effect.

[This link opens to a video with a different medical philosophy. It's worth clicking on, no matter one's skepticism.](https://youtu.be/CFtsHf1lVI4?si=c7HOzpchsB2NeP1-)

I was also on antipsychotics, but these next chapters will not be about antipsychotics (see ["Geriatric unit hospitalization"](#geriatric-unit-hospitalization) for some elaboration on antipsychotics), since the benzos were added on top of them, making their evaluative efficacy compared to the damage from benzos hard to disentangle. The rest of this Part will be about the experience that was most-plausibly caused by the benzos.

Let's begin a simplified explanation of the brain's neuron. Neurons are cells that are connected to one another by dendrites and axons that pass chemical messengers from one neuron to downstream neurons. The two most common chemical messengers in the brain are the excitatory neurotransmitter Glutamate and the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Excitatory means they cause the next neuron to also release their neurotransmitters ("fire"). Inhibitory means they lower the voltage activity of the next neuron such that the next neuron is subdued. GABA is the mechanism of action of alcohol. People think alcohol is "disinhibitory," that it "disinhibits" them, but the reality is alcohol is actually inhibitory. It confuses GABA receptors, causing an inhibition of that neuron and all the neurons in your brain. It's a system-wide drug that indiscriminately simulates GABA throughout every part of your brain, from the Occipital lobe, where your eyes see (in the back of your head), to the frontal lobe, where your brain thinks it thinks.

The brain has evolved some countermeasure thanks <!--at least--> to fermented fruit existing in nature.
<!--
Benzos are GABA agonists, like alcohol. That means they simulate GABA or enhance GABA receptor function. In response, the brain downregulates GABA production and receptor sensitivity universally across the brain, universally, from the parts that are understood to the parts that almost entirely aren't, including some of the most important regions of intelligence whose healthy metric level of functioning is extremely hard to measure behaviorally, clinically, and longitudinally across variants of factors, and necessary for quality living, e.g., the hippocampus responsible for long-term memory. Alcohol does this too, but humans have provably evolved natural mechanisms of recovering from small doses of alcohol thanks to fermented fruit existing in nature. Benzos seem like a Godsend, a Panacea, especially since you're less likely to feel a headache the next day from them for the same effect, but the [evidence isn't strong enough to support they're better on the brain in the long-term than alcohol](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/drugs-linked-to-brain-damage-30-years-ago-2127504.html). From what I've gathered, benzos are worse. Since it's somewhat relevant, [here](https://youtu.be/TEKgesBVTJ0?si=OtXQYMZgVd3Qu36M) is a video I made on evolutionary algorithms in deep learning.

Nobody understands this mechanism. To understand this mechanism, you'd have to solve all of neurology and artificial intelligence, and psychiatrists definitely haven't. Benzos are a floodbath of GABA, and your brain responds to those GABA bursts by "downregulation," even long, long after cessation.

Despite the similarities to alcohol, benzos are synthetic, achieve much the same effect without a person being able to notice the same short-term consequences like immediate hangover, and are often prescribed to be taken daily for long periods of time. [Studies haven't shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10309976/) that the long-term consequences are preferable to those of alcohol, many [quite the opposite](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8629021/), and <!--(at least)--> my experience<!--, as well as that of [many others](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/), taking only as prescribed, were--> was so severe that I <!--would--> strongly bet worse.

## Trauma

This malpractice revolves around three psychiatrists.

**PSYCHIATRIST 1:** "I will taper you off from the benzos. You will be tapered off *before* discharge."

> `Psychiatrist 1 reassured, I'll be weaned off from the benzos,` *before* `discharge from the hospital.`

**PSYCHIATRIST 2:** "The tapering schedule is too fast (even though we decide when to discharge you) and the outpatient doctor, the psychiatrist after the hospitalization, will taper you off. You will be tapered off *right after* discharge."

> `Psychiatrist 2 came in on the momentum of her previous post (to replace Psychiatrist 1), and changed the schedule, standing next to the first psychiatrist, who hesitantly, self-doubtingly told her that he'd planned to taper me off before the discharge since I was worried.`
>
> `Maybe she didn't trust that I would continue with therapy if the physiological addiction didn't send me there by threat.`
>
> `But she reassured, I'll be weaned off from the benzos,` *right after* `discharge from the hospital.`

**PSYCHIATRIST 3:** "Benzos can be safely taken for years. You need to take them. I want to increase the dose. Did you pull your hair out yourself?"

> `I told Psychiatrist 3 my symptoms. He was cold, authoritative, and disbelieving. He only believed the benzos were needed. He said that benzos could be safely taken for years, and didn't counterargue my points against that that I made to him. At no point for the next 5 months would he specify a tapering schedule, and I was arguing and begging him to taper.`
> 
> `He asked about my hair loss, whether I had pulled the hair out myself. He wouldn't believe me the first couple times I answered. Not only didn't I pull it out myself, but the medical system did, the one that was now making me answer repeatedly whether I did.`
> 
> `I kept begging him to taper in later sessions as well, and he said if I was having all those negative symptoms, that we should increase the dose. That would've started a perpetual race against the brain's downregulation mechanisms.` *He wanted to increase the dose.*

I argued against the benzos with all 3 psychiatrists.

With Psychiatrists 1 and 2, I only took them due to the threat of court order.

With Psychiatrist 3, I only took them due to (a) his recommendation and instruction, (b) the guilt about the earlier hospitalization, and me questioning even the most basic logic and instincts I perceived, while noticeably, adding extremely to the self-doubt, my brain was running slower than others due to the drug, thinking I really was sick in the way these doctors understood, (c) the mental impairment induced by the drug, and (d) insecurity about tapering off by myself, amid the severe physiological dependence.

Furthermore, they were treating a misdiagnosis, "catatonia"—that's what the benzos were prescribed for—that I never went through. I couldn't explain that to them because (a) I didn't know the definition of "catatonia" yet, and (b) the trauma of what I went through was too recent to summarize. 

> `In RGH, they were prescribed due to that false diagnosis of "catatonia." The University of Rochester's Strong Hospital wanted to prevent a recurrence—that is, "preventatively"—threatened a court order if I didn't take them, and 3 psychiatrists changed, contradicted, and perpetually extended each other's scheduling for the taper.`

Additionally, maybe the most unbelievable part: they didn't ask about what I went through. They treated "catatonia" and "bipolar mania" as the indubitably exhaustive description. "Catatonia," which is what the benzos were meant to treat, was fully a misdiagnosis. The other diagnosis from the medical record was "bipolar mania," for which I was being given Risperdals, a strong antipsychotic, in addition to benzos. None of the previous diagnoses from the first hospitalization, none of what RGH wrote, were investigated or asked about in any extent by the University of Rochester's psychiatrists.

Due to their practices, I was on benzos for >6 months. 

Symptoms from taking the benzos as prescribed included: 
- [Severe cognitive impairment](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/cdmid6/is_extreme_brain_fog_normal_before_even_beginning/)
- [Constant rightward spinning sensation](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/h8n3ve/lopsided_and_slanted_kundalini_sensations/)
- [Tinnitus](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/j1finq/tinnitus_in_just_left_ear/)
- Mouth dryness, and tooth calcification, as diagnosed as being due to benzos by dental hygienist
  - Chunks of what I thought were tooth were falling out after the benzos that she diagnosed as decalcification
- Severe generalized anxiety, previously undiagnosed
- [Severe social anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/dzx7or/not_to_get_into_toxic_territory_but_sometimes_i/)
- Inability to sleep due to anxiety
-  [Memory loss, and "greyness" of imaginative and creative ability](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aef90661-f01c-40bc-b8b9-b0a101b80d92)
- [Severe loss of speech and writing quality](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aef90661-f01c-40bc-b8b9-b0a101b80d92)
- [Severe pain](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/dyaf8n/constant_chest_pain_that_spikes_into_my_neck/)
- [Facial structure changed, wrinkled, and my face rapidly lost a healthy appearance](https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1dyn2es/comment/lce3ie3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) 
- Severe physiological dependence, which benzos cause more so, at least neurologically, than Dupilumab, which also causes/caused a physiological dependence
- PTSD from all of these symptoms and the recurrence of a malpractice-induced perhaps-permanent trauma
- [Scientifically-backed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10309976/) fear of permanent damage
- [More than a year of all of this, no sleep, non-stop persisting neurochemical torture](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cksl7u/health_disaster_brain_damage_alopecia_universalis/)

Almost nearing Fall, 2019, I tried to kill myself. The helium tank connected to tubing was found by my mom, and my family hid it from me.

A deeper summary of my benzo trauma can be found [here](5-Opposing-Views.md). <!--[here](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/4399be6729f1369e27a3df35eef58fbfe94dcf23/2-Opposing-views.md#my-trauma).-->

The experience of losing my hair has cost me relationships and worsened my social anxiety, and the benzo-brain damage and torture leaves me with PTSD.

## Dyeda

### War

When the Nazis came to Ukraine, they did not arrive as strangers. Long before their boots touched the soil, anti-Semitism had already taken root among many of the populace of Ukraine. The Jews of Ukraine—Ashkenazi Jews, like my family—went from persecuted to tortured, including forced displacement, and mass killings, with many victims executed and buried in mass graves. My Dyeda ("grandpa"), Yury, only 13 at the time, fled with his mother, Maná, and younger sister, Rosá, escaping eastward to the relative safety of Kazakhstan, as many other Jews evacuated similarly.

Years later, when the war ended, they came back to Chernihiv. Yakob, Yury’s father, had been drafted to fight for Ukraine. He survived the war, and they were reunited—husband with wife, father with children. For years they had been apart.

### A New Name

At 16, my grandpa formalized his name on the official record. He was born "Izya," a Jewish name, but in a world like his, being openly Jewish was dangerous. He adopted "Yury"—a name that could help him survive. The nickname for "Yury," which he also went by, was "Yura." During the war, his documents had been lost, and when he had to make things official, he chose "Yury" for good. His last name, though, stayed the same: "Lerman," an old Ashkenazi Jewish surname with German origins.

### Asya and Yury

After the war, my grandfather went to college in Kiev. My grandmother, Asya—a Rabinovich—was in the same city, attending a different college. They had known each other as children. She was a year older. They crossed paths again, and this time, they got married. She took his surname, "Lerman."

Not long after, the Soviet Union sent my grandfather to work as a leather technology engineer at a sheepskin factory in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. So, in 1952, my grandparents left behind Kiev, Chernihiv, Zhytomyr—all the places that were tied to their lives in Ukraine. They moved to Samarkand. My grandmother, too, made a new life there, teaching German.

### Samarkand

Samarkand is an old city. Maybe [one of the oldest in the world](https://www.advantour.com/uzbekistan/samarkand/history.htm#:~:text=Samarkand%20is%20one%20of%20the,goes%20back%20in%20remote%20days.). It’s been standing for thousands of years, its [architecture modest yet beautiful](https://travelcocktail.org/samarkand/). Back in ancient times, it was a key stop on the Silk Road, where trade routes from [China, India](https://www.britannica.com/place/Samarkand-Uzbekistan), [and Europe](https://www.euronews.com/travel/2015/10/19/samarkand-s-silk-road-treasures) all met. In the Soviet era, Russian became the dominant language, though Uzbek was used in official documents. Islam is the main religion there, then and now. Samarkand is a [city of intersections](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/603/)—intersections of history, culture, and commerce. Its original name, Maracanda, goes back to the 4th century BCE.

In that city, my uncle Slava was born first, then my mother, Nélya. Later, my aunt Jenya had two daughters, Lena and Irina, with Lena being the oldest. All of us—my cousins, my sister, and I—were born in Samarkand, Ashkenazi Jews all heritage sides, in an ancient, multi-ethnic city.

My mother was 33 when she had my sister, Marina. Five years later, at 38, she had me. My sister’s name was inspired by Maná, but my mother wanted something different, so she chose "Marina." My name? "Sam of Samarkand" emerged only after we immigrated to America. My real name is Siímyon. I was named after my grandmother’s sister’s late husband, Siímyon, who passed away years before I was born. But my family calls me "Syoma."

"Sam of Samarkand" (nor "Marina of Maracanda," actually) wasn’t planned. It just happened. My name took an especially roundabout path from Siímyon, ultimately becoming "Sam of Samarkand" in America [independent of any of us](3-Opposing-Views.md#immigration).

### Ancestral Innocence

The war and rough upbringings mean my family neurologically has some downregulated levels of GABA, and perhaps toughens through what most would call PTSD, in the way hobbits do: cheerfully, working hard, not realizing the pressure on us.

It takes a lot—a lot—for that awareness to realize.
