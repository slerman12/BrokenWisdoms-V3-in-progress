# Part 4.1

## Henry Kautz

The top-three contest-winning Parkinson's disease progression models I built at the Med Center in college as an undergrad earned me a recommendation back to Henry Kautz, [as well as an embarrassing interview](https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/undergraduate-students-place-in-top-three-in-parkinsons-disease-data-science-contest-228912/). On top of that, I built [a sleek website interface for Twitter GNIP's involved data mining API](https://github.com/slerman12/TwitterDataCollector) for Henry's research group, and some sundry research projects together with one of his PhD students, and was praised by other affiliates of his that he recommended me to, at [Bryx emergency response](https://bryx.com). As a result of my skill, combined with appreciation for my extracurricular breadth, Henry accepted me into his PhD group as a doctoral student. 

- I first injected Dupilumab summer, 2017
- My first semester in the PhD program began in Fall, 2017, with Henry as advisor
- I lived in the [House on May St.](1-Medical-Malpractices.md#house-on-may-st) for about a year, when, in 2018, Aetna cut me off from Dupilumab and my hair rapidly fell out

### I Ching, and Losing Faith in Me

We finally got a delivery of the drug. I wasn't sure whether it'd be safer at that point to re-instigate the dependency/addiction or avoid the drug at all costs.

Here's a personal story, since I was fixated with Taoism at the time:

To help me weigh the difficult decision—and it was difficult because that medication was extremely potent and didn't even help my eczema much, and I believed my hair would grow back—I asked the I Ching. Here I'll describe the hexagrams I got because I find it interesting that one of the predictions came true, and this might be medically useful since it corresponded thrice with my hair growing back (all three resurgences after the Alopecia Areata had developed into Alopecia Universalis, meaning after every piece of hair from my body had fallen out).

`The Alopecia Areata had developed into Alopecia Universalis.`

The I Ching "answered" it didn't matter which of the two paths I chose ("The town may be changed, / But the well cannot be changed. / It neither decreases nor increases." - "The Well", unchanging). Maybe an interesting observation: that the English "well" is phonetically similar to "wellness," as well. 

Stay patient: It also had previously "answered" my hair would grow back of its own accord, which it did, temporarily. I still remember: "Difficulty at the beginning" (as Richard Wilhelm described: "The name of the hexagram, Chun, really connotes a blade of grass pushing against an obstacle as it sprouts out of the earth—hence the meaning, 'Difficulty at the beginning'.") $\rightarrow$ (changes to) "Fellowship with man" (e.g., baldness). 

That answer about whether my hair will grow back came true with the steak-only diet (steak is "manly" and so that again ties to the hexagram symbolism of "Fellowship with man," which I learned about with the recommendation [from Mikhaila Fuller](2-Medical-Malpractices.md#jordan-peterson)), almost like a suggestion for how my hair can "sprout" out of the earth, my head, like blades of grass, again... which it did, temporarily but covering my entire head except for an unnoticeable tiny spot<!-- at the top of my scalp-->.

1. Then all the head fell out again. Again, total baldness. No eyelashes, eyebrows, or head hair.
2. Another time I did the steak-only diet, my pubic hair fully grew back—temporarily.
3. Another time I did the steak-only diet, a few eyelashes grew back for the first time. 

That can't be a coincidence, so I leave this story here both for medical utility and for the reminder that [I now look like Gollum](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10211230008185126&set=a.1273659620707) because of medical malpractice, but furthermore, to point out that my doctor didn't contact or warn me about the drug no longer being delivered again, once again not spotting the interruption of drug on which a patient might be dependent, and warning the patient about the necessity of a gradual withdrawal process—if one such even existed at the time. For the second time, deliveries ceasing from the deliverer wasn't caught by the doctor, if even a medical judgement about how to taper after months of withdrawal already could be communicated, in the management of a volatile drug prescription a patient has already suffered. 

The deliverer called me before that last delivery. When I didn't approve the delivery, they just accepted it. They didn't contact the doctor. Maybe they did. I didn't hear from them. Nobody further pushed  or informed to maybe go through a withdrawal process, neither before I'd started the drug nor during treatment, nor after the initial interuption, that gradually lowering the dose bit by bit might've still been necessary after the withdrawal period induced by the cessation.

`The deliveries of the drug stopped again and neither the deliverer nor doctor warned that a gradual tapering would still be needed.`

This wasn't obvious, having already been off the drug for months, and trusting my own body, as well as a pretty convincing I Ching answer, which, even in this context, may have been right.

Admittedly, the look of someone relying on medical advice from an ancient Taoist book, lacking any timely other, <!--with a backlogged doctor who takes weeks to months to get a scheduled appointment with,--> combined with the alopecia universalis, makes me look rather like an obsessive maniac, if not physically literally like Gollum.

`I now look like Gollum`, and `then other Gollum-esque symptoms` (see ["Fall, 2018 semester, and the Dead Marshes"](#fall-2018-semester-and-the-dead-marshes) and ["Nails"](6.1-Medical-Malpractices.md#nails)).
<!--`I now look like Gollum`, and, though I didn't specify them yet here, there were `other "Gollum-esque" symptoms` as well (see ["Fall, 2018 semester, and the Dead Marshes"](#fall-2018-semester-and-the-dead-marshes) and ["Nails"](#nails)).-->

Perhaps this makes the hair loss look like my fault, and undermines the 3 self-induced regrowths.

Oh but for why the full head of hair of 1. fell out *again*, in 2021, see ["Geriatric Unit Hospitalization"](6.2-Medical-Malpractices.md#geriatric-unit-hospitalization) and ["Second Induced Hair Loss."](6.2-Medical-Malpractices.md#second-induced-hair-loss)

### Fall, 2018 Semester, and the Dead Marshes
  
After the house on May St., it was from my mom's apartment (in 2018) during a video call with my advisor that I described that [biologically-inspired neuron architecture](2-Medical-Malpractices.md#benzodiazepine-benzos-mechanism-of-action), with the specifics in the [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i5hS2iDVuo24PnGicvn5dIZYXUzDfPAl/view?usp=share_link) comparing it to the LSTM architecture.

I also presented a description of the LSTM cell, then layer, then network, then bidirectional layers with attention, to my Semantic Parsing class from the ground up using that [biological formulation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i5hS2iDVuo24PnGicvn5dIZYXUzDfPAl/view?usp=share_link). My fellow PhD student told me in our office that it was really original, and she liked how I didn't use the usual LSTM diagram. The class was impressed with me.

Also in that 2018 Fall semester, Henry made me apply for the NSF GRFP, one of the most competitive fellowships in the world. I submitted a personal background and research plan that got [excellent reviews](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alder-tree/Assets/refs/heads/main/BrokenWisdoms/NSF-GRFP.png), with one of the reviewers writing, "This is exactly the type of high-risk, high-reward research that the NSF is looking for to support." I proposed my long-term episodic memory model, biological neuron, and relational reasoning via MHDPA to feed "relational concepts" into a long-term memory.

As I worked on the NSF GRFP submission, I kept asking the I Ching for advice, in addition to Henry, Sri Pai, and Charles Venuto. The former tended to give the most consistent, helpful answers, and for most of the writing process, very positive and encouraging. By the "former," I mean the I Ching, but the three professors also were encouraging, read my submissions, looked at different drafts, and helped. Their opinions contradicted each other, especially on the choice between two versions of the research plan I wrote, where Henry and Sri, both Computer Science, preferred one, and Charles and someone my age I liked, and I, preferred the other. I ended up going with the one the CS professors preferred. It was more structured and rigorous-looking, but less natural, profound, and lacked as much of a deeper philosophical meaning<!--dimension-->.

Towards the end of the submission, just when I was ready to submit my final versions, including that structured research plan that the CS professors liked, the I Ching's tone had gotten far more ominous in its answers, consistently, suddenly, no matter what I asked it, whether it was the choice between those versions of the research plan, or different edits I considered or came up with. Its predictions were all negative. I submitted what I had, since the deadline was <!--around--> that day, and the result ended up being a very unfortunate "honorable mention," wherein all of the reviews were excellent, except one "Good" that tilted the scale. The last's reasoning? I didn't have enough paper publications, as he'd ["have expected"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alder-tree/Assets/refs/heads/main/BrokenWisdoms/NSF-GRFP.png) from someone with such an interesting submission. Otherwise, it was a good submission, but [without paper publications, he couldn't give me an "Excellent."](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alder-tree/Assets/refs/heads/main/BrokenWisdoms/NSF-GRFP.png)

It was a lot of work, but concurrently, amid yet-other grad-level courses, I worked on my MHDPA innovation paper, as the semester project for the Semantic Parsing class. Neither Henry nor the professor had heard of MHDPA back then. Henry critiqued my use of the term "relational reasoning" to describe it, now the convention. Dan wrote that I wasn't clear on the math, and needed more equations. The amount of math I used fully described the method and was/is the convention.

But a strong interest or fascination with MHDPA, in 2018, didn't come by accident. Today, people who've heard of MHDPA have heard of it because of transformers, like the kind that underpins ChatGPT. In 2018, even an NLP professor whose students worked with deep learning models, including sequence-to-sequence attention models, as Dan was, was unlikely to have heard of transformers, let alone MHDPA, and of course Henry for that matter, since his background was in symbolic AI, and included little, if any, deep learning experience.

Henry was worried I was going to do the entire PhD by myself, and by email wrote, "The only thing I'm worried about on your behalf is that there is no one in Rochester who knows enough about deep learning to mentor you."

After the house on May St., I was coming up with and seeking a method that could do relational reasoning in deep learning. That is how I found MHDPA so early, before it had much recognition or almost any application (besides some groups at DeepMind) in the field. I was coming up with my own concept of relationally-attending-to image-features, and researching to find if anything existed in line with those principles, and (after [Relation Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01427)) I found the other DeepMind applications in [reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01830) and [RNN memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01822), respectively. I was coming up with a relational disentangled-attention type method for use as "relational representations" in a long-term episodic memory, and later how to innovate MHDPA for that purpose, a consideration that led to the innovation I evaluated on a question-answering dataset for my Semantic Parsing semester project, which outperformed the baseline MHDPA. Henry discouraged me from initially submitting my [paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qgmmzgsrctmg#6cd1b9) to the ICML conference. Later reviewers hadn't heard of MHDPA, (dismissively) compared it to other preexisting attention mechanisms (having conflated MHDPA as my innovation), and critiqued that I didn't have enough experiments. The class project got an A. <!-- Adding experiments, back then though, wasn't so easy, because infrastructures for transformers and those benchmarks didn't exist. I programmed in TensorFlow 1.0 and Sonnet, in 2018. Furthermore, it would have gone deep into-the-weeds of something I wasn't primarily building the method for, so I proceeded with a mix of my own plans, as much bigger obstacles added themselves from the medical system, an unforeseeable change involving Henry's employment, and hugely-intensive demands that followed, not just benzos, but in vast majority consequences from benzos, and by the time transformers exploded, the method lost relevance in a saturated field, and I'd already been put on multiple new intensive projects that I didn't have much choice in. By the time I had a chance, I was now answering much more heavily to an overseeing authority, and tried to find time for other research directions that, unlike my method from 2018, at that point were still looking far ahead beyond where the rest of the research zeitgeist was. I didn't realize for a long time that I was the first to innovate on MHDPA, and that if not for the coercion of benzos, I would have very plausibly gotten credit for it.-->

<!--
Henry and I both didn't have experience with deep learning prior to when I entered the PhD program. Up until that summer before my first year as a PhD student, I had been working with random forest models. I had to teach myself—really quickly— and through hard-to-believe intuition, the full state of the art and then some as I started the program, as I took grad-level depth and "breadth" courses, none of which at the University of Rochester were especially helpful, and my professors and students around me had very little to offer.

That being said, and most CS students can relate to this: in college, most of what I learned was self-taught. That of course didn't change in the PhD program, as the professors were still bad teachers, except also didn't know anything about the material that would need to be taught, the state of the art of their own fields, yet. 

I'm not trying to be mean to anybody. This is the truth. It's hard to express, because it implies that the world is bad, that people with authority are stupider than they're credited and esteem themselves, that they're not just stupid, but actually really, really, like really stupid, and in vast majority. THAT might make writing and reading this hard. It might make it hard to believe, if you haven't seen this for yourself, as a student. I'd say the same about the other PhD students though. I'd say this about every professor and PhD student who was in the CS department. Not personally, not that they're always stupid, but that, in general, they were. Undergrads maybe see grad students as knowing so much more, but those grad positions, and professorial, don't require intelligence to earn, usually. In most cases, actual intelligence, or anything actually novel, would get in the way.

Most people get into those positions through natural memorization ability, or obsessive memorization, and then make some minor deviations from what was taught to them that they call research, and that combination of memorization and very-linear tinkering gets esteemed if they're able to write it up in the standard academic jargon. That last part—jargon—is most of what academia beyond the memorization-stage requires. Even those professors who make a dent, often get there by luck, usually around a really simple idea sufficiently complicatedly executed.

In med school, the ability to memorize which prescriptions correspond to which diagnoses, and which diagnoses correspond to which symptoms, and which anatomical events correspond to which symptoms, is something ChatGPT-like AIs can pass [exceptionally](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18416), with [even better bedside manner](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00099-4).

I went to a conference that year, NeurIPS, 2018, in Montreal. At the time it was called "NIPS, 2018." I met the DeepMind researcher Ryan Faulkner, who co-authored the [RNN memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01822) paper, that innovated on the RNN cell by applying internally the MHDPA method, who was so impressed with me, perhaps because of the really-concept-understanding comment I made at his poster session about disentangling something in their memory cell to improve their method (independent to what I'd been researching, completely to do with his method), that he invited me to lunch, and during lunch, as we were talking, he said he would recommend me to a position at DeepMind if I applied, back in 2018. 

I was walking around Montreal with headphones in my ears, listening to Of Montreal by momentum from listening to it by coincidence before the conference, and working, working really hard, in my hotel there. There was a group chat for people visiting for the conference, and lots of social events that I missed. I wanted to go to a hot tub party, but ended up working. I wanted to go to "strip karaoke," but was practicing strict ascetic disciplines, and asked the I Ching. The I Ching gave a resounding no. On the floor of my hotel, I cast the Feng Shui coins, and got the ominous hexagram "Decrease," and to my regret (having never gone to anything like either of those things), I listened, stayed in isolation, and worked. The snow outside was beautiful, and at least I walked from time to time to explore and to get groceries. "Organic" food is apparently called "biologique" in French.

I met Jürgen Schmidhuber in the conference itself, at his talk, was the last in line, had to wait longer than everybody, then talked to him a bit, he was friendly, and he shook my hand. I sent him a followup email, he replied, and it meant a lot to me.

I was wearing a hat all through the conference, to cover up my baldness, that I still wasn't used to, and still am not. It was winter, and the winter hat didn't look too out of place. Early December, less than three weeks before my RGH hospitalization.

The encroaching mental state on the social and self-image-based fronts <!--began its march-->escalated quietly in the background of my consciousness from the hair loss, in particular my already-poor confidence about my [physical attraction.](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/dzx7or/not_to_get_into_toxic_territory_but_sometimes_i/) <!--Can also link: https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1dyn2es/comment/lce3ie3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button-->

When I returned, my isolation on the work-based front stayed deep, as I was getting ready to submit my MHDPA innovation paper, coinciding with my first-ever hospitalization, the second time my frontier research ideas (the earlier alluded to in part in the [House on May St.](1-Medical-Malpractices.md#house-on-may-st)) coincided with a sudden major health crisis, either 100% externally caused in the first instance, or unprecedented for me, almost suspiciously so<!--,--> in the second. 

I was also doing yoga, together with meditation and pranayama, every day, intensely and in deep trance through each session, by myself on a yoga mat or the floor, a yoga taught to me through the advanced technique of TM, that was being taught in tandem with a meditation retreat at a zen center I went on, earlier on my 23rd birthday, on November 18, 2018, where one of the instructors actually learned that it was my birthday and brought me cake and got everybody to sing happy birthday for me. It turned out, rather ironically/unfortunately, it was somebody else's birthday that day or weekend, too, who was in the large dining area where the instructor brought me cake, announced to everybody (against my will) that it was my birthday, and they all sang to me, but not to him (not knowing it was his birthday). He later told me at that event<!--, with good humor-->. All the people there were older than me.

This period was an extremely isolated time of work and esoteric in-the-weeds revelation. Besides stacks of printed academic papers, I was reading The Lord of the Rings, and there was one chapter that I read precisely in this narrow time span (the meditation retreat was a different time span) after I returned from Montreal, "The Passage of the Marshes," that resonated for its eerie imagery. 

Frodo and Sam are being led by Gollum through the Dead Marshes. It's an eerie chapter, as Gollum's world seems to be the ruling one now, and Frodo and Sam are navigating at his back through the boggy peril.

I was going deeper and deeper into a psychotic state, both of (a) brilliant awareness and foresight about my field's fundamental principles and trajectory, and (b) isolation, as if I was traversing by the lead of Gollum through the Dead Marshes.

> [!NOTE]
> Quick forewarning, and since the house on May St., I was building a Keras-type framework for long-term memory for the Medical Center, including the semester I did my MHDPA innovation paper, that had generalized neural episodic control into a framework that I could use for disease prognostication, very novel, and which I’d also suggested could be used for interpreting exactly what measurements of a patient’s history informed the model’s predictions, similar to how attention weights <!--might-->more commonly do today. This amounted to nothing, but informed my future contemplations about long-term memory, and curiously forebodes what turned out to be the major project of the second half years of my PhD. 

## <!--Psychosis-->Crisis

### Tao as the Optimization of a Differentiable Universe

> Editing in progress

Since my realization that the physics of the universe could be intelligent, plausibly, through the sampling mechanisms in quantum physics' probabilistic nature, and together with the acute state of consciousness I acquired through meditation, including the physical sensations in my esophagus and within my body that I had acute control of, as well as those viscera sensations I experienced in yoga, I was highly conscious of a force in my body that I could guide, but also that seemed to have some guidance of me. This guidance, I interpreted as Tao, the universe's natural changes, the universe's natural erosions. But those changes and erosions don't always feel like that, as guidances, so specifically, I thought the state of consciousness I was experiencing, the same one with which I found the I Ching's answers to be improbably precise to my questions, had some mechanism tied to the physics of Tao, that they were not just in tune with arbitrary changes, but specific changes, that the Tao intended. Specifically, I realized that the Tao is optimizing the universe, and that the universe might be "differentiable," but that some states of consciousness might be "more differentiable" than others, more in line with the Tao's ability to predict and plan.

But some of these guidances were more sensible than others. Perhaps some were Tao, and others, in the I Ching's language, were "grace."

The I Ching had called those disruptions, the less sensible guidances that also appeared, "Grace." And in Taoist philosophy, "Grace" isn't necessarily good. Those winds, as they push us, are, to put it in Richard Wilhelm's words, "beauty in form," and in the I Ching's taxonomy, such a state to a person's psyche and cosmology "has success in small matters […] but he dare not decide controversial issues in this way." But if there's any doubt to the authenticity of these experiences and beliefs, let it be known that the I Ching gave this answer exactly the morning of the day before the crescendo of my psychosis, in an especially relevant answer to my question about whether the state of consciousness I was increasingly feeling was still based on primarily truth, or delusion.

Let $Q$ be a qualia function, and $\theta$ the parameterization of the intelligence of the universe via the probabilistic samplings of particles within a bounded statistical divergence from the probability distribution of the particles, e.g., from the normalized wave function of the particle. $\Omega$ is the universe, Tao/God as the process of optimization of the following objective:

$$\max\limits_\theta Q(\Omega_\theta)$$

Qualia is defined as the yogas, the emotions, and their richness, goodness, beauty, and sacredness, relatively ranked numerically in the universe by the qualia function $Q$. 

Those senses, however, as I described went into increasingly “Gollum-esque,” psychotic places, less in the nature of a proof of the beauty of the power of consciousness and perhaps the universe, but more in perhaps the bogs of obsession, recent trauma, isolation, intricate understanding, and incongruently deep transcendence. 

### Wind

It was literally a wind that pushed me into the woods. 

I had left my apartment thinking my heightened energies were draining my mom, and walked through the snow aimlessly, but adhering to senses and what I thought were Tao guidances, to make a distance from her. Then I reached a road near the more commercial district, and then I turned towards the woods direction, and last second, I saw a man coming out of his car, and I shouted "Hey!" and I asked him if he had gloves, and he did and he gave them to me. 

Then, still not knowing I was going into the woods, a wind pushed me. A wind blew and I walked into those woods where I sat, in meditative silence, and peace, near a prettier part of the brook, thinking I had to stay there for a week, and if I did, my mom wouldn't die. 

And I stayed there, completely immune to the cold, but protected, physiologically, by a single coat, sweatpants, and those gloves that were given me. 

Somehow, from the moment I'd left my apartment door, to the rest of this venture, except for a health concern, the cold didn't feel too cold. My body, in this energy state, adapted so well. Humans have evolved mostly in the Ice Age. I cannot tell you the medical implications of how much power the body has. I was there, from the early morning I left to the rest of the day, in the cold, that through this extreme, psychotic/delusional, transcendent energy state didn't faze me in the slightest, didn't bite the way cold is thought to supposed to, and it varied—you see, every disobedience to the guidance of my energy state resulted in a physical grasp of me by the cold; I would shiver and shake, at increasingly extreme levels the more I stopped adherence. But as soon as I returned to adherence, the cold and the shaking stopped. 

This is not trivial. This reproducibly felt like a physical relationship between me and the cold, where had I disobeyed the exact adherence of my psychic state, the particles of the cold would (or I should say "did") get me. The shaking then wouldn't even vary. It would appear in exact increment proportion to my deviation from the adherence to that mental state. 

Still daylight, the meaning of ["Life is suffering,"](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-second-noble-truth/201609/existence-is-suffering) as it's colloquially said that the Buddha had said, decryptified to me: "Life itself, the source and the living, is currently suffering, in the world." I imagined grass dying as a symbolism for this interim worldly state of things. "Life is suffering," however, is not a permanent state or law of nature. It is the ongoing situation of life in the world.

It was at night, near 2 AM, 3 AM, or 4 AM when that terrible peace turned into a (different) kind of panic.

> [!NOTE]
> This was about 5 - 8 months after the hair loss. No prior history of psychosis or mania.

An ambulance found me, wet with brook water<!--, potentially at risk of frostbite-->. The only answer I gave as to what happened, was "for pleasure," here and thereafter, under the delusional belief that my mom's life was in danger if I didn't adhere to that secrecy.

### Rochester General Hospital (RGH)

#### Christmas Eve/Day, 2018

By chance, my psychosis happened from the morning of Christmas Eve to the morning/night of Christmas day, 2018 when the ambulance found me. By chance, since my only reason for doing this, the not-fully-specified <!--self-endangering--> ordeal, was fear that my mom's life was in danger, and whether it was a Christian holiday or not was irrelevant to me since my family is Jewish by ethnicity and was secular. 

My interest in the I Ching began in the House on May St., when I heard of it by chance through hearing again a lecture from [Terence McKenna](https://youtu.be/9E5eBqG0cds?si=AZVe2xQMEci2s7Rr), who I used to enjoy in college. It resonated because of the randomness-dependent theory I had, and I ordered a Richard Wilhelm translation and copy as well as some Feng Shui coins. 

A nurse was there to help thaw my legs to prevent hypothermia and frostbite.  My legs were thawed in some machine and my mom arrived. I was still afraid her life was in danger, but I didn't say anything. I didn't talk much.

The nurse remarked on some damages I had. 

#### Catatonia, or Yogic Guidances

<!--Then in a different bed, while doctors or nurses or attendants were in the room, I felt some strange thing happen with my tongue and throat, like my tongue was going back into it: my mouth opened wide, and i-->
<!--
They brought me to a different room. One moment I was moving and walking, the next the intensity of the hospital environment guided me into a contortion. My mouth opened wide, it was as if my tongue went back into my throat—then it was as if I swallowed my tongue—and like the whole [Kundalini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini) that had "risen," although actually it was the physical inner sensation that moved through different parts of my body, that in the House on May St., through meditation, I had full control of, acutely—like with the brilliance of puppy's eyes, and on 3 axes of movement—had been swallowed, as if shoved down my throat by the hospital. Whatever that sense was, was a real physical thing.

I went into a conscious yogic surrender of all muscle. Even as the doctors picked me up, placed me down on wheels, and wheeled my limp body forward to the MRI machine, I stayed adherent to those [guidances](#Crisis), still thinking something important was at stake, if I disobeyed.

Then my sister came into the room. She saw me, staring forward, and gently touched my arm with a finger. A spark. Maybe just in my eyes, or from the corner of my mouth, but I gave an imperceptible smile. I was afraid. She told the doctor/attendant she thought she saw me smile. The doctor/attendant, standing nearby, declared calmly I was unconscious. 

A couple days later, an injection of benzos brought me out of the yogic state sooner than I'd planned to stay in it, as the daze of the benzos made me uninhibited to the perceived responsibility. Thereafter, as I noticed from my first meditation sensations in RGH, the Kundalini sensation, rather than descending or being adaptive to my will, was kind of locked up, uncomfortably, rigidly in what to this day seems like a less acute state of consciousness than the adaptive inner acute dynamics.

That sensation, however it moved through my body, was real and physical.

I surrendered to whatever movements were demanded of me. Every muscle in my body relaxed into what felt like a conscious yogic submission. Even as the doctors moved me, placed me on a stretcher, and wheeled my limp body to the MRI machine, I remained in that state—still thinking I was bound to something important, something that would be lost if I disobeyed the [inner guidance](#crisis).

Then my sister entered the room. She saw me staring ahead, and gently touched my arm with a finger. A spark. Maybe just in my eyes, or from the corner of my mouth, but I gave an imperceptible smile. I was afraid. She told the doctor/attendant she saw me smile. The doctor/attendant, standing nearby, declared calmly I was unconscious.

A couple of days later, an injection of benzos pulled me out of the yogic state earlier than I’d planned to leave it (3 days was the hallucinated/believed instruction and 2 days was how long I waited). The haze of the drug dulled my inhibitions, and I let go of the perceived responsibility. But what followed wasn’t a return to the <!--fluid,--> adaptive sensation<!-- I had once known-->. <!--Instead, t-->The Kundalini, <!--once--> dynamic and responsive, felt locked inside me—rigid, unyielding, and far less acute than before. I first noticed this during meditation in RGH.

### Discharge from RGH

I didn’t know the term *catatonia* at the time, and I was following a yogic grace/guidance out of fear for my mom’s life—not because I couldn’t move or respond. I could have exited the state I was in, but the doctors never considered that possibility. What I was experiencing wasn’t catatonia, and their misdiagnosis overlooked that crucial distinction.

I ran the final experiments for my [MHDPA innovation paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qgmmzgsrctmg#6cd1b9) within just days of that, fully out of that altered state of consciousness now, in the hospital since the hospital staff allowed my mom to bring my laptop in.

Then RGH discharged me not much more than one week after admission.

More than two weeks since the first hospitalization, I end up not sleeping all night. My sister happened to visit the next day. Due to having not slept all night, she was worried I might be going through another "manic" episode and insisted to my mom and me to drive me to Strong Hospital. The doctors at Strong Hospital didn't question the prior "mania" nor "catatonia" diagnoses, nor ask for any further details about that earlier hospitalization or the--> <!--preceding--> <!--events.-->

I didn’t even know what "catatonia" meant, what its definition was. What I was experiencing was a yogic guidance, driven by the fear of my mom dying, and I could have exited it if I decided to. But the doctors didn’t consider that possibility. They simply settled on the misdiagnosis.

Then, only a week after admission, RGH discharged me.

More than two weeks later, I didn’t sleep at all one night. The next day, my sister, concerned that I might be going through another "manic" episode, took me to Strong Hospital. The doctors there didn’t question the previous diagnoses of mania or catatonia. They didn’t ask for any details about the events leading up to my hospitalization. The same assumptions were made without reconsideration.
