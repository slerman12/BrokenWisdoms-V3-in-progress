## Flying Colors

<!--
The first psychiatrist was young, soft and gentle-eyed. Maybe not a rookie, but close enough to still have enthusiasm. The kind of guy who wears his scrubs like he’s one step away from happy hour, the sort who still remembers what it was like to be human and not just some overworked automaton. I walked with him down the hall, and I think he thought I was sharp. I think he thought I was actually interesting to talk to. And sure, I was under the sweet haze of benzos, so I felt sharp. It wasn’t so much my intellect as it was the way the drug draped everything in a golden glow. I was brilliant. I was lucid. My thoughts were all connected in this colorful, radiant thread that I could almost touch. I was the goddamn sun. I was a walking TED Talk. Let's call this luminescence, "flying colors"—a term stolen from Henry.

It wasn’t my intellect, but how the benzos wrapped everything in a golden glow, combined with my articulated intellect. Let's call this luminescence "flying colors"—a term stolen from Henry.

I convinced him, or he understood my worry, and he said I would be weaned off the drugs before discharge.

<!--
The second psychiatrist, a stern, astute Asian woman, came in on the momentum of her previous post and quickly changed the plan. Standing next to the first psychiatrist, who hesitantly mentioned he’d planned to taper me off before discharge since I was worried, dismissed it. She said the tapering schedule was too fast, and the outpatient doctor would handle the rest of the tapering right after discharge.
-->


<!--
Enter the second psychiatrist. Stern. Serious. She had the air of someone who’d climbed her way up the ranks, whose posture screamed "no-nonsense." Without malice—she wasn’t dismissive—but there was something about the way she looked at my chart, at me, that said she had zero interest in playing nice. She was about facts. She didn’t have time to entertain your theories or your "concerns." If she doubted the first psychiatrist’s plan, it wasn’t personal; it was just... pragmatic. She looked at me like I was a problem that needed solving. The first psychiatrist—hesitant—tried to explain we'd planned to taper me off before the discharge since I was worried. But she had no time for this, and made a firm decision. The tapering schedule? Too fast. She assured me, with the same level of emotional detachment as a traffic light, that I would definitely be weaned off after discharge.

She said the tapering schedule was too fast and the outpatient doctor, the psychiatrist after the hospitalization, would wean me off, but this time, she gave the reassurance to me, that I'd be tapered right after discharge.

The first psychiatrist was young, calm, cool, soft, gentle eyed. As we walked down the hall, he seemed to think I was sharp—not because of my everyday personality, but because the benzos wrapped an effortless clarity around everything I said. Let’s call this clarity "flying colors"—a term I borrow from Henry.

<!--The first psychiatrist and I walked together in the hall and he thought I was bright. The social lubricant of benzos gave me a visibly colorful brilliance that I think he reacted to as authoritative, about my knowledge of benzos and intelligence.

I convinced him—or perhaps he would’ve agreed with my worry anyway—and he reassured me that I’d be weaned off the benzos before discharge.

<!--
A week or two later, the second psychiatrist entered. She was an Asian woman, stern and astute, detached and efficient. After glancing at my chart, she said the tapering schedule was too fast, and that the outpatient psychiatrist would handle it after discharge. The first psychiatrist, self-doubting, noticed my worry and emphasized that he had intended to taper me off before discharge. She dismissed his effort. She disagreed and reassured me that I’d be tapered right after discharge.
-->
The second psychiatrist was Asian, taller than him. They were in my room. She was stern about the tapering schedule being too fast. The first psychiatrist still felt belief based on the first conversation <!--about tapering me off--> with me. He mentioned it, the plan to taper me off<!--it-->, <!--to see if that was the energy (meaning, he brought it up kind of-->but hesitantly, self-doubting<!--)-->. She was stern, <!--but-->and reassured I was going to be tapered right after discharge by the outpatient doctor. That was the only time I saw her. It was a 2 minute conversation. 

She appeared a week or two after the first one, who said I'd be tapered off before discharge, who I convinced in our conversation walking together in the hall. That was the only time I saw him, besides that next meeting, by the way.

<!--
The benzos were prescribed without any effort to learn what had been happening with me, and this lack of investigation was on top of me being given Risperdal, a strong antipsychotic.
-->

In case the durations of those conversations don't make this clear, to be clear: the benzos, and Risperadol, were prescribed without any effort to learn what <!--had--> happened <!--or had been happening--> to me, the same ones that were also threatened to be taken at court order, and, later, prescribed indefinitely by the outpatient doctor.
<!--The benzos, and Risperadol for that matter, were prescribed without any effort to learn what had been happening with me.-->

#### From RL to "Many Worlds," and Other Research

Before my area exam, I was building a vision transformer for generalizing across Sonic the Hedgehog levels, but I didn’t realize it was a vision transformer (in the Computer Vision domain) since it was purely applied to reinforcement learning, and the crux of it for me was to use disentangled relational representations as queries to the episodic memory (k-nearest neighbors, made differentiable via weighted averaging attributed rewards), meant to give the episodic memory more generalizability since the relational representations extracted parts and their relations rather than the full entangled context, effectively treating the MHDPA heads like an ensemble of independent memory queries using my disentangling method from my earlier paper. This is still an extremely insightful symbolic understanding of how models can generalize across domains, where the relational representations are the generalizable components and the episodic memory was like the parameterized or recurrently-stored knowledge trained into models today via giant data corpora, except in both cases more explicitly programmed in as novel inductive biases. None of this was appreciated by my department, whatsoever. 
- I was studying reinforcement learning (RL), from DQN, to policy gradients, to actor-critic, since the beginning of my PhD. It was at the forefront of my research, but completely unsupported and un-believed in until ChatGPT, which, besides MHDPA, was able to train human feedback into the model via an RL type algorithm, not exactly reinforcement learning since N-step future rewards aren't used—more like moving parameters in the direction of a gradient to maximize outputs that are assigned higher rewards by humans—analogous to policy gradient methods in RL—but enough to lend credibility to RL's utility for the first time in my PhD. The models that succeeded ChatGPT may have been less simplified, using actor-critic type behavior maximization rather than policy gradients, which are a little weaker. The full potential of RL, using N-step reward, over long time-scales, online learning, and multi-agent, is still unrealized. Exploration sampling is analogous to beam search type methods, and the latter could be applied, hypothetically, to environments in RL, as is actually the best technical analogy for "Many worlds."

<!-- [TO DO:: Add Henry quote from interview about worrying about AI being like "worrying about traffic regulation on Mars"] --><!-- I'm the martian, perhaps who will undergo a hard "execution"] -->
<!--
Also before my area exam, I taught Henry "sequence-to-sequence attention" from my office, in a state of misery that I couldn't convey, as I was also working on further innovations to MHDPA, now suffering due to grad-level classes, TAship, impending area exam, and the brain damage. I tried to tell Henry what was going on and he couldn't understand the severity, giving me an anecdote about his son's medication.

Henry edited down my MHDPA innovation paper to submit to a workshop, cut down some pages, and I submitted it. It was rejected. At this point, I myself, like Henry, doubted that the paper really had value. Amid my brain damage, there was nothing but despair.

## Benzo Torture

### Area Exam (and All As)

#### Step by Step<!--Classes, Paper, and Research-->

Amid the first months of the course of benzos, as my cognition was fading and world was gray, but not yet at my most severe, the demands of the Spring, 2019 semester were afoot.

My uncle told me, "step by step." Each day I worked, a little at a time.

I had grad-level classes that I had to pass after being hospitalized during the early part of that semester, was TA'ing Philosophy of Consciousness, had research I was still trying to do, and spent every day writing a little bit towards my area exam paper.

The area exam is the biggest defense besides the thesis, a big many-page paper, and an in-person presentation and oral defense.

I spent each day writing, step by step.

#### Outpatient Doctor

The first psychiatrist said I'd be weaned off before discharge. That was the schedule. I was able to articulate colorfully to him with an intimate/earnest social charm that I wanted to be weaned off from the drugs before discharge thanks to the early drunkenness-like effects of the benzos, a luminescence I'm referring to as "flying colors." The social lubricant of benzos gave me a visibly colorful brilliance that I think he reacted to as authoritative, about my knowledge of benzos and intelligence. I didn't have such a voice with the second psychiatrist, even with the first one in the room, and she changed the plan to tapering immediately after discharge via the outpatient psychiatrist, as was still the plan at discharge.

By the time of discharge, the color film was faded, the "flying colors" had faded. It was Oz in reverse. The psychiatric unit <!--was the-->could be likened to the "Wonderful Land of Oz," with me colorfully drunk on the magic benzos they were giving me at threatened risk of court order, and by the third "healer's" pen click, the tornado had begun. The third psychiatrist, the outpatient doctor, also University of Rochester, was categorically, unarguably bad. If there could be a DSM-5 yellow-brick-manual definition for bad, it would just be a picture of him. In the second month with him, 3 months into the benzos, my cognition was not just grey but Requiem For A Dream-grey, anxiety constant. [My memory, speech, and imagination were gone](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aef90661-f01c-40bc-b8b9-b0a101b80d92). From his disbelieving clinical authority, all of my symptoms were, wrongly, attributed to the earlier diagnoses. 

<!--The Hell was indescribable, literally. Attempted to write it 500 times. I'll put it in the "Benzo Torture" document. It was like Schindler's List-grey, not even a little girl carrying an umbrella.-->

<!--The Hell was indescribable.-->

<!--Apparently, [it is not uncommon for outpatient doctors to continue a course of benzos after inpatient psychiatrists expect discontinuation](https://thischangedmypractice.com/long-term-benzodiazepine-mortality-schizophrenia/).-->

<!--Perhaps "flying colors" has something to do with the reason.-->

#### Classes and Discipline

I got extensions for one class, help from another PhD student on one or two problems for the homework and with understanding material from another class, and visited one of the professors at his office hours for help as I was running late due to the hospitalization. I scored straight As. This<!--, area exam work, and research--> took spirit and luck, as well as my continued disciplines, including <!--**-->daily meditation, strict Paleo diet, cold showers, and Wim Hof method; and asceticisms, including no movies, TV shows, etc.<!--**-->, human spirit that should not be underestimated, yes, amid brain damage and torture<!--, and—most certainly not Paleo—having to consume nearly half a gram of benzos in total over the course of these few months, deleteriously racing away the benefits of each of these disciplines-->.

It's the hardest thing, to describe how I can get all As and do extraordinarily well in a semester under the conditions <!--I described earlier. That is what my family is like.--> of the benzo nightmare.

<!--
During one meeting, I taught Henry "sequence-to-sequence attention" from my office, in a state of misery that I couldn't convey. In that meeting, I tried to tell him what was going on and he couldn't understand the severity, but gave me an anecdote about his son's medication. Henry was beyond supportive, and I feel bad that he was powerless in helping me beyond how much he did. Actually. This isn't an indictment of him.

- Twice-daily meditation
- Strict Paleo diet
- Cold showers, and Wim Hof method
- Asceticisms, including:
  - No movies
  - No TV shows
  - etc.
- Working step by step every day

#### Brain Damage

I told the third psychiatrist I thought I was brain damaged, and that I was in physical pain, and that I'd read from multiple scientific studies that [brain damage from benzos may be permanent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10309976/), and he didn't care about the [many scientific studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15762814/) I may have hypothetically read, because every word I said was devoid of believability—not colorless from outside, but agitated/irky/murky, like my inner anxiety was attacking him. So he reacted by saying that increasing the dose would be the best course of action. I begged him to taper, and he said if I was having all of those negative symptoms, that he should increase the dose. Out of fear that he would, I had to withold the intensity towards the end of that session.

Starting some months [(maybe 4th month) into taking the benzos](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/cdmid6/is_extreme_brain_fog_normal_before_even_beginning/), I was laying on the couch, immobilized, shaking with excruciating agony. No sleep, no escape. No exit, just PhD work, literally fighting through peak of human spirit, in torture. All color gone, all imagery, all imagination, only pain, perpetual pain and fear. Terror. Terror terror terror. I remember one day trying to do $4*7$, and not being able to. 

I saw him for about 4 or 5 months and don't remember his name<!--, my cognition was so greyed-->.

[Nobody understands neurodegeneration](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-024-03437-5), but what I suffered was physical brain damage.

[Tinnitus](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/j1finq/tinnitus_in_just_left_ear/), [a constant rightward spinning sensation](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/h8n3ve/lopsided_and_slanted_kundalini_sensations/), [wrinkles](https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1dyn2es/comment/lce3ie3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and mouth dryness added to the mounting evidence of damages happening not just to my psyche, but to my body's physical and neurological structure.

Henry had said, empathetically, "You look terrible."

#### Rehearsal in Front of Uncle and Mom

At the end of the semester, it was time to prepare for the oral presentation portion of my area exam.

I rehearsed the area exam presentation in front of my mom and uncle for a week, one or more times each day, for each day before the morning of the in-person area exam defense with the faculty, of whom there would be 8 or so. Since I could barely think, remember, or go a moment without wincing pain, I planned taking my benzos on the day of the exam at a higher dose than usual, in order to be able to function, as the symptoms of the downregulation were now beyond severe. To prepare and test the efficacy of an increased dose, I rehearsed one day at a higher dose in front of my mom and uncle for them to evaluate, to test first that it helped. They knew. Both dosings were intelligently planned and necessary for my functioning. 

Amid the grey, the cognitive decline, and the shaking anxiety of the state of my brain's GABAnergic system, they were also necessary to the treatment of my social anxiety, heightened by the induced impairments and tortures, which is what they were originally prescribed to me for, in college, before the "catatonia" misdiagnosis. 

It's unethical that I had to take them to meet a requirement, given the context of not wanting to be on them in the first place, and the same university institution that induced the trauma being the one now evaluating me for that requirement. The coercions snowballed, little did the <!--different-->little branches of the university — a monopoly — realize.

My benzo torment lasted for more than a year, and in that time, I had to take an irregular dose one other time. This other time was to give [the poster presentation for the Med Center](#charles-venuto) at a conference in DC, which has since benefited me in no way, the one where I also presented the website I built, also a high dose, also an unwanted dosing, also necessary to my basic functioning <!--under-->for that <!--socially and performatively-intensive--> task.
<!--, since that also involved cognitive performance in front of down-looking authorities in a higher-pressure requirement with no other non-risky alternative. Rewinding to main timeline...--><!-- later, where at the conference I presented my website and prototype, that I had to build while under all of these work, hellmouth, and hellfire conditions, that they liked, all were impressed by, hired a team for, and didn't credit me.-->

#### Inability To Defend 

I was in more cognitive decline with each passing psychiatrist. The euphoria was turning into grey cloud and fog, more cognitive impairment, anxiety, excruciating anxiety, and [a constant rightward spinning sensation](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/h8n3ve/lopsided_and_slanted_kundalini_sensations/), which persisted for more than a year.

He wanted to increase the dose, as if that would reduce my brain's increasing system-wide downregulation of GABA, rather than worsen its effort to fight the dysregulation. In case you're wondering, he was an idiot. The brain damage, and literally — when memory, speech, and imagination are all impaired, and the patient's in pain, *the brain is damaged* — risked being permanent and irreversible, according to [(many) studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15762814/) I found and the [fact that nobody understands neurodegeneration](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-024-03437-5). 

I write this with the same truth value as "the Holocaust was bad": I should've weaned myself off then, or better yet, immediately<!--, as soon as I could've started weaning-->. The brain's GABA being downregulated is like living in an active war zone. Coercively induced, it is, without exaggeration, a legalized form of torture, neurochemical waterboarding, except the effect persists beyond each cranium drowning, *without a moment's break*<!-- for air-->. By the next month with that doctor, around month 4 of the benzos, I wasn't able to recall well even important <!--personal--> memories (including personal ones like grandparents death months) or easily do basic math, grey cognition, non-stop anxiety, non-stop torture. My writing quality went extremely down on anything that was social or creative or not dependent on previous memory. What I suffered was physiologically brain damage. 

My cognition and perception deteriorated severely, and [a constant rightward spinning sensation](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/h8n3ve/lopsided_and_slanted_kundalini_sensations/), [tinnitus](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/j1finq/tinnitus_in_just_left_ear/), mouth dryness, and [wrinkles](https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1dyn2es/comment/lce3ie3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) added to the mounting evidence of damages happening not just to my psyche, but to my brain and body. I was in severe pain and agony. He responded with only authority, no reasoning, and no sensitivity. He didn't believe any of my arguments. He made no consideration to the possibility that I was right or he was wrong. His clinical authority meant more to him than my agony. His perpetuation and amplification of my suffering, attributed reasons (despite good arguments that I made, but which were too agitated for his belief), and fears was afforded to him only by his disbelief and my drug-induced insecurity about weaning off by myself. The third psychiatrist, is like Schindler's List-grey, like not even a little girl carrying an umbrella. <!--I saw him for about 4 or 5 months and don't remember his name, which is too bad, or I would write it here in capital letters.-->

What goes beyond the articulation of the dangers of benzos, or the inconsistencies between the psychiatrists, is that the entire administration of the benzos, which became traumatic, was based on a false premise. Adherence to yogic-type experiences—whether or not they were delusional, whether or not they were safe to intervene on with drugs—is not the same as "catatonia." But the real issue isn’t just the misdiagnosis of "catatonia"—nor that no one bothered to investigate either way—but if they had, they probably still would've landed on the conclusion that the disorder fundamentally was stemming from me, not them.

To explain that or anything to them, the pressure was higher with each subsequent psychiatrist because those intrinsic "flying colors" became increasingly <!--faded-->swirling grey agitated pain. The preceding trauma took the last 5 years for me to process into a form that I could write, let alone speak, let alone boil down into a spoonful under pressure. Depending on which version of this book you are reading, <!--the description of that crisis might be largely omited.-->that crisis might not be described at all, here. This version that I'm writing now only includes a very brief description of the fear of mom dying, snow trek, sitting in the woods, and brief reference to having jumped in a brook, the total of which is already more than the psychiatrists knew or inquired about.

<!--My "flying colors" were increasingly faded, the clarity, the ease with which I could make my case, --><!--impoverished and--><!-- starved. And with them, my ability to defend myself was diminished. If "flying colors" couldn’t carry me through these clinical encounters, I was left to the mercy of whatever was written on the page of my medical records—unless some shred of my credibility could pierce through their established protocols. The longer I stayed on the drugs, the harder it became to make my case and more necessary. Each passing day carved through my capacity to advocate for myself, while the pressure to convince them to stop the drugs, as their effects on and in my body accumulated, mounted.-->

#### with Flying Colors

I passed my area exam, for which I had to write that 30ish page paper amid those courses, TA'ing, and my research, that I defended about a few weeks after the close of the Spring, 2019 semester, "with flying colors" according to Henry.

The other faculty were probably mostly impressed by my "flying colors," as my personality was made vibrant by the benzos I had to take at a higher dose that morning to function, but that’s not how Henry meant it.

[My slides for that area exam were also quite colorful](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LK0urIs8yu_e7HyZ-VQoDJUiGpPeTPEUgfhjK5Kw_7w/edit?usp=sharing), also not how Henry meant it.

That semester, Henry had helped me rework my MHDPA innovation paper into a workshop paper. He pretty much cut it down himself, edited it, and put together something [short that can be submitted to a workshop](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hwsvdmvqydxw#021442). It was really short, and I wasn't sure would still make sense, but my cognition wasn't good enough, nor did I have the time that semester, nor was I physically strong enough, to do more than what Henry did, and amid my agonized state, I actually had no faith in myself, and after the torment, I wasn't sure where the work stood in terms of actual importance or just crazy exalted projection from psychosis. I was really grateful for Henry reworking it himself. I didn't and don't blame him, but his 3-page version got rejected. Much was truncated to fit the workshop required page limit, including <!--much of the early motivation-->most of what I think made it make sense and contextualized it. After the area exam, and before learning the rejection decision, he sent me this email:

> ### $\Huge &#8220;$
> Congratulations again on knocking it out of the park at the Area Exam!
>
> I wish I had not discouraged you from submitting the full version of your paper to the actual ICML conference, but you'll be able to submit it somewhere later this year.  In my defense, I never really "got" what you were doing until your presentation this morning!
> ### $\Huge &#8221;$

And I replied:

> ### $\Huge &#8220;$
> This means a lot to me. Thank you so much, Henry.
>
> Although, I’m not totally sure the paper will get accepted to the ICML workshop - I don’t think I motivate it well.
> ### $\Huge &#8221;$

My [area exam](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LK0urIs8yu_e7HyZ-VQoDJUiGpPeTPEUgfhjK5Kw_7w/edit?usp=sharing) shows how much of a plan I had and what kind of progress I could've made, given the mantle on my own brain and research, without medical malpractice obstruction.

Charles also sent me an email:

> ### $\Huge &#8220;$
> Nice job this morning.  I along with the other committee members were impressed with your presentation and overall approaches. Exciting work ahead! 
> ### $\Huge &#8221;$
> 
And *by chance* (since the other 7 faculty didn't), Chenliang CC'd me on his confirmation:

> ### $\Huge &#8220;$
> I attended Sam's area exam and approved the assessment made by the committee.
>
> Chenliang
> ### $\Huge &#8221;$

My uncle was worried I wouldn't pass, and we all celebrated joyfully that I did. The area exam is the University of Rochester CS department PhD program's biggest defense other than the thesis. Students are awarded a master's degree for a successful area exam defense, which includes the 30ish-page paper I wrote and oral defense<!--, which in my case included many faculty,-->. What it took was my earlier stock of genius, and through an extremely dedicated human spirit fighting literal brain damage on will alone, I wrote a genius paper that probably no one read, and took a big dose of benzos to present it, passing with "flying colors," officially a master's student at extreme torture, Spring, 2019, celebrating uncharacteristically high afterwards. 

My family besides me also have higher-level degrees. My mom, a master's degree in music theory. My uncles Slava and Sasha, PhDs, in physics and mathematics, respectively. My cousins, PhDs in dermatology and pharmacology. My sister, nurse practitioner (master's degree). And my best friend, also in a PhD program (immunology) but in another city. All were proud of me. None knew all the details of the hospitalizations. Henry of course didn't either. This book is the real-time processing of that memory and the rest of these memories, all traumatic and extremely hard to write (see the number of commits this book has, look through the commits to see how hard I struggled to express any of this, and other versions of this book in other repos and on my other GitHubs, maybe that I will make private, where some of this effort to describe and editing also took place), into writing.

#### Oral Defense

At the area exam, I presented word by word as I rehearsed. 

Henry [is/was one of the top AI researchers in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kautz). Compared to some other professors at the University of Rochester, he did not think deep learning was a fad, and had some intuition about ideas like the biologically-inspired neuron in the diagram [earlier](#benzodiazepine-benzos-mechanism-of-action), though not always of involved ideas, like the use of attention mechanisms (e.g., MHDPA). 

Henry recommended the following time allocation for my area exam:

> ### $\Huge &#8220;$
> - Plan to speak for 20 minutes
>   - Clarification questions will be asked during the talk
>   - Try to respond clearly and simply 
>   - Given 10 minutes of such interruptions, the presentation will take 30 minutes.
>   - If you think you are in danger of not completing in 30 minutes because of interruptions, let me know right there in the talk and I will ask further questions to be held. We do not want to allow the presentation to run longer.
> - Then there will be 30 minutes of questions from the faculty.
> - These can include questions not just about your presentation, but about *any* topic from the AI or machine learning courses that you took

The person who will be my next advisor (see ["Red light at Clover St."](#red-light-at-clover-st)), was my machine vision professor from my first year, Chenliang Xu, technically not in the room during the area exam, and was answering the Skype call from China. He was the only person in the meeting who asked for elaboration on how I planned to do ["relational representations"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LK0urIs8yu_e7HyZ-VQoDJUiGpPeTPEUgfhjK5Kw_7w/edit?usp=sharing) for vision with image features from a CNN (technically a Vision Transformer, what I described), since he didn't know what MHDPA was (neither did my NLP professor in the semester before my hospitalization) and I went back to [slide 11](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LK0urIs8yu_e7HyZ-VQoDJUiGpPeTPEUgfhjK5Kw_7w/edit?usp=sharing) and re-described MHDPA to all of them again, and the fact that Chenliang was the only one of them who <!--showed interest in--><!--asked about-->had any special interest in the method that most revolutionized the next years of their fields, during either the 20 minute speaking portion or that 30 minute question portion, is a synchronicity, because, due to causes that were independent from the area exam<!--, yet more unforeseen causes of the choices of other people that I had no say in-->, the one professor who I can be sure caught such an important detail without needing much spoonfeeding (compared to some others, anyway) or the entire field hopping onto the bandwaggon (sort of), as would soon follow, <!--though I can't read the minds of everybody who was present,--> by independent chance became my next advisor (see ["Red light at Clover St."](#red-light-at-clover-st)). 

Most of the questions weren't technical. Of everybody, Henry tried to ask the easiest question, but his turned out to be the hardest. I don't remember what it was, only that my answer had to be vague and gentle to his not total understanding. That being said, he felt the colors, saw the logic, maybe wasn't specifically convinced about MHDPA and how it connected to relational reasoning, maybe didn't understand the specifics necessarily, but appreciated the work.

I was more than capable of tackling any challenging question about any of the specifics of my work, or even something more philosophical and profound, thanks especially to this moment of remission from the months of excruciating agony, as benzos draped the air with bursting rainbows of GABA<!-- once more-->.

<!--He was satisfied with my answer because I answered it well, but in all likelihood he didn't remember.-->

### Hellmouth and Hellfire

#### Grey, and GABA Downregulation

As any shaman does, I have become a Master by way of drug.

Before my area exam, I taught Henry "sequence-to-sequence attention" from my office, in a state of misery that I couldn't convey, as I was also working on my application of MHDPA for vision in RL, now suffering due to grad-level classes, TAship, impending area exam, and the brain damage. I tried to tell Henry what was going on regarding the benzo agony and he couldn't understand the severity, giving me an anecdote about his son's medication, and in the state of misery and extreme pain I was in, the moderate empathy actually conveyed less understanding, so I can't exactly praise him for that, but very strongly tried to preserve his love as the pain enswelled. The explanation of sequence-to-sequence attention didn't win him over much.

At after the 6 month point, I started gradually reducing the dose, now entering the ["hungover" chemical waterboarding phase](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cksl7u/health_disaster_brain_damage_alopecia_universalis/).

They say the only thing to fear is fear itself: GABA downregulation is fear itself. The experience is like being in a warzone. It's like burning alive—without stop—more than a year, torture. The neurochemical experience is literally what you go through if you're in a warzone, and being chased by a predator, while in the middle of having a seizure: hellfire, indescribable pain. I remember staying up nights shaking, just shaking, electricity swarming through me, my face curled, deformed as I tensed and agonized all night unless I got some sleep if I was lucky and then waking up feeling like that, again, for the rest of the day, every day, for months like this. 

[Even at lower comparative doses than what I took, by people who are seen as teachers of manliness,](https://youtu.be/laheAXdZK7w?si=FuPXGh1cLuuvtfHW) this experience of misery and crippling agony is experienced (debilitating).

Skin dry, teeth calcifying (at a dental cleaning appointment, the hygienist diagnosed it as calcification and the attributed cause as dry mouth due to benzodiazepines), no memory, no linguistic expression, cognition completely grey and burning. 

I remember trying CBD oil or L-theanine to try to sleep. Latter didn't work—the CBD oil, which I got from that herbal apothecary near the house on May St., when I stopped in because I didn't know that building had become a herbal apothecary, helped a little, and after I talked with the store workers about the different herbs and chemicals they had with probably way more knowledge than they expected, the person at the counter asked to add me as a friend on Facebook, which was serendipitous and miraculous for me, but then she stopped replying as soon as I messaged suggesting they host meditations in the park next door because my wording/thinking was probably [awkward](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/dzx7or/not_to_get_into_toxic_territory_but_sometimes_i/), due to literal brain damage from the benzos. The personality consequences of the extreme [anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/dzx7or/not_to_get_into_toxic_territory_but_sometimes_i/), [brain fog](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/cdmid6/is_extreme_brain_fog_normal_before_even_beginning/), and [impaired speech](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/316ec47a-248e-4141-9eb7-5888bc1ea93d), plus total hair loss, harmed my social life more than can be stated, and lasting trauma regarding people from the interactions with the psychiatrists and medical staff coercions.

These symptoms [persisted](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/dyaf8n/constant_chest_pain_that_spikes_into_my_neck/) for more than a year, and the trauma persists. <!-- I've read former cocaine and heroin addicts anecdotally report that long-term benzo neurotoxicity involves more horrific suffering than withdrawal from cocaine or heroin. --> 

I saw anecdotes [in this website](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadPill/) from former addicts of heroin or cocaine who were on benzos, who reported that those side effects and withdrawals <!-- of benzo-induced GABA downregulation --> were worse than the side effects and withdrawals that they had suffered from heroin or cocaine (and similar type anecdotal reports comparing the drugs elsewhere, e.g., probably abundant [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/), though at the surface hard to believe). I'm sure there isn't an experience on this Earth that is worse, humanly or cosmically possible (a year without sleep, non-stop neurochemical fire, not sure that's even imaginable). 

#### Teeth-Falling-Out Literal Nightmare

You know, the way I learned about the calcification was because chunks of what I thought were tooth were falling out. Just chunks of tooth-like pieces from my mouth. So I went to the dental hygienist and she said it was de-calcification. This was already when I was starting to recover to some extent, when I was already on the steak-only diet. To reiterate: it started *de*-calcifying at that point. The calcification built up a lot during the 6 months I was on benzos and withdrawal. That was her diagnosis: decalcification due to dry mouth from benzos. The steak-diet saved my teeth, I think.

`As if losing my hair, eyebrows, eyelashes, nails, cognition, and skin weren't enough.`

#### Suicide Attempt

While I was living in the House on May St., and still in the early stages of my work, Henry wrote to me, “Ideas are cheap. Execution is hard." However, I have a pretty good track record of following through on my ideas. 

The benzos forced on me an idea that almost become too much of an "execution."

The risk of mortality was a foreseeable outcome <!--by my psychiatrists-->from benzos, [as published study data shows](https://thischangedmypractice.com/long-term-benzodiazepine-mortality-schizophrenia/), that suicide is a probable risk <!--in long-term benzo usage of patients presenting symptoms similar to mine--> in the symptomatic context of my medical record seen by my psychiatrists.<!-- that was included in my medical record.-->

During this time, my mom found and my family took away the helium tank connected to plastic tubing in a bag I was going to kill myself with.

The trauma I went through during my psychosis (which the psychiatrists didn't even know about, or consider had a hint of beyond what what was written in the medical record, and the entire exhaustive description of which <!--is omitted-->isn't even included in this version of the book, so far) doesn't compare to the upwards of a year of benzo neurochemical torture that was induced on me. 

### Machinery Behind the Curtain

What could've caused three psychiatrists, with zero consensus between each other, and zero consent from the patient, to cause so much damage? I suspect the >5 months of inconsistent psychiatrist and doctor plans were due to the self-reinforcing biases clinicians (in the general sense) can create in themselves as they change a patient's personality through chemical interventions. My personality started very charming and cheerful due to the benzos, at which point they still planned to wean me off within the hospital. Then fear and anxiety rose due to increasing downregulation. As those induced neurological changes "doctored" my perception and psyche, my believability lessened (due solely to reduced neurological function, not any fundamental behavioral change aside from mental impairment, and no catatonia, or mania, or delusion), and each changing shift of psychiatrists extended the asserted duration of the coerced prescription of the previous, changing the plans of the previous psychiatrists, culminating with the outpatient doctor only willing to increase, with no taper schedule on the planned horizon. Doctors are aggressively playing Gods, and have no understanding of the severe bias that their own interventions produce in their own or each other's clinical decision-making. Measurement-bias is a known problem in science. Detection can result in a change in the state of the physical system (or organism or body) being detected. In medicine, this problem is less widely understood since the subjects being observed, detected, analyzed, judged, and changed are people.

Apparently, [this is not that uncommon, for outpatient psychiatrists to contradict the expectations of inpatient psychiatrists to discontinue benzos](https://thischangedmypractice.com/long-term-benzodiazepine-mortality-schizophrenia/). 

- The drug empire was disguised as the University of Rochester.
- The drug dealers were disguised as the University of Rochester's psychiatrists.
- The benzo drug market is a $3 billion industry disguised as the University of Rochester's medicine. 

Suspiciously, there were even contradictions in recent studies from previous decades, on the same drugs: ["the Medical Research Council (MRC) in Britain agreed in 1982 that there should be large-scale studies to examine the long-term impact of benzodiazepines after research by a leading psychiatrist showed brain shrinkage in some patients similar to the effects of long-term alcohol abuse."](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/side-effects/201011/pharmaceutical-scandal-in-britain-sheds-disturbing-new-light) The study was buried: ["The only problem with the MRC's response to such warnings about benzos? It appears to have sat for thirty years on the very documents that warned about the risks of brain shrinkage in patients taking them. Moreover, the MRC appears to have marked the documents 'closed until 2014,' despite their obvious importance to public health. [...] 'Members of Parliament and lawyers,' she continues, 'described the recently revealed documents as a scandal, and predicted they could lead the way to a class action costing millions.'"](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/side-effects/201011/pharmaceutical-scandal-in-britain-sheds-disturbing-new-light)

> To do: remove redundant information below about how my grandma got dementia chapter, and move additional relevant information from here there.

As these months progressed, my [facial structure changed, wrinkled and my face rapidly lost healthy appearance](https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1dyn2es/comment/lce3ie3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), so much so as even my advisor remarked, empathetically, "You look terrible." Measuring damages to an intelligent person's intelligence fully is impossible. I was able to get straight A's in my grad level classes, TA a class, and pass an area exam in the time that I was brain damaged, even worse than I'm describing now. And that took a lot of resourcefulness, will, and spirit, like Matt-Damon-potatoes-on-Mars kind of human spirit, that can't be underestimated. But if *those* grad-level metrics can't measure the damage to my cognitive functioning, how could the tests that psychiatric researchers who believe benzos "can be safely taken for years"<!-- have-->? My grandma, in her early and later dementia, passed every test, like picking between two index cards about a color previously shown or reciting numbers that the doctor had just cited, and unambiguously to both family *and doctors* had dementia, dementia, the worst possible case scenario of this, and one that [studies have also shown benzos contribute to the likelihood of in elderly people](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6325366/)—and for that matter, how have any psychiatric research protocols evaluated whether somebody taking benzos in their 20s doesn't contribute to the likelihood of their dementia in their 80s? My family is intelligent, and we have a lot of will to work really hard. My friend, who was triple-majoring at the University of Rochester, told me she was driving once on acid. I was like, "Really, how?" and she said, "It's mostly muscle memory..." In other words, even under an extraordinarily altered state of consciousness, like the kind induced by acid, she would still plausibly be able to pass a driving test, and the same is true for drugs that alter one's consciousness, body, and neurology harmfully. No existing set of tests can measure how much an intelligent person's life, personality, cognition, and everything by which they live by, can be destroyed by the damages that psychiatric drugs cause which are hard to articulate and express in the midst of subjectively, even when those damages are extremely overt, and are incredibly insidious to the "more objective" tests that psychiatric researchers have, tests that try to come up with a metric for intelligence, the solution to which (used as a label source for a differentiable discriminator) would literally solve all of AI. 

ChatGPT, perhaps itself a wizard behind the curtain—an artificial program—could pass their human cognition or psychiatric tests with flying pixels, probably better than a human in good health.

In med school, the ability to memorize which prescriptions correspond to which diagnoses, and which diagnoses correspond to which symptoms, and which anatomical events correspond to which symptoms, must be most of the work, since according to medical professional evaluators, ChatGPT and similar LLMs can pass medical reasoning and behavior [exceptionally](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18416), and with even better [bedside manner](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00099-4) than their human doctor counterparts.

Until recently, [lobotomies](https://psychcentral.com/blog/the-surprising-history-of-the-lobotomy) and [conversion therapies](https://time.com/6344824/how-common-is-conversion-therapy-united-states/) were standard psychiatric practice. Coercion in psychiatric medicine, especially long-term, especially of benzos will be recognized by medicine as barbaric.

As it turns out, the disorder was with the psychiatrists all along. "Toto, we're not in Xanax anymore," the University of Rochester medical system says to itself, as it peddles more big pharma flying monkeys. When the prison guards are criminals and the prisoners are saints, things are backwards. Likewise, when the doctors are drug dealers and the patients would be exalted in Tibet or other cultures for showing early signs of shamanic intuitions (as both Jeremiah and Sarah did, <!--I later came to learn from direct undeniable experience with them,--> and as [others who presented similar symptoms to mine](https://youtu.be/CFtsHf1lVI4?si=c7HOzpchsB2NeP1-) did, myself included), there's a disorder *of* the system, and it's not one that's classified in the DSM-5.

### Beginnings of Recovery

I had to buy waist straps to finally start to recover because I couldn't sit up from the debilitated position I shook with anxiety in on the couch.

The steak diet, which I began after the severest of these symptoms and withdrawing from benzos, in Spring, 2020, helped my cognitive-energy-mood recovery.

And after all of this, [literally nothing was cured](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/kvbjhs/does_anyone_feel_physically_moved_by_some/). Which reality—theirs, wherein the conditions that lead to hospitalization are accidents that need to be militantly defeated (wherein meditation, yoga, good social life, intelligence, healthy Paleo diet, and maybe even an antipsychotic wouldn't suffice), or mine, wherein their practices are full of "psychiatric disorder" (and, as ever more abundantly shown, more than just psychiatric, but environmental, dietary, social, and more)—makes more sense?

### "Medical Leave" Semesters

Before my recovery<!-- from the benzos-->, I built the disease prognostication website. I wouldn't be emphasizing this so much if not for the outcome of my PhD that will be discussed in the next chapters, but it was my idea that I had to argue for, build, and prove to convince them it was a good idea. Through brain damage, I built it, proved the concept to bosses and other researchers through hard work and an actual programmed, designed, and deployed [prototype](https://github.com/slerman12/DiseaseModelingWebApp), including the [prognostication models](https://github.com/slerman12/DiseaseModeling/tree/master) and all of those past years cleaning up and building on the previous data cleaning code and models, and presented it at a conference in DC where I had to retake a dose of benzos to cognitively function. They took the idea after liking my version, they gave me no credit, not even for arguing for it<!--convincing them--><!-- it was a good idea-->, and they hired their own team to build it with plans for patenting. <!--I believe, at this time though, Henry had aranged them as the source of my funding via the "Udall Center grant," "designed to support innovation and discovery in Parkinson's Disease."-->

The next semesters, my classes were okay<!-- or coercive. I had to take Program Synthesis with Sri Pai, a professor I really like. It was still hard. B- was from a different systems professor, for which the story is quite bad. A fraction of a point, separated me from a B, even after I came into his office and he was ready to bump it up, he probably wasn't satisfied with the lack of flying colors I had and didn't believe me that my work would involve systems, and at the end of the meeting, decided to leave my grade at a B- for Operating Systems, and because I got a B-, in Operating Systems, like 0.1 of a point difference from B (since it would be rounded up), I had to retake a grad-level systems class, since PhD students are required to get a B or higher. A was Program Synthesis, the class I chose to meet the retake requirement, in which I educated Sree and the class about deep learning (AI) for program synthesis, the state of the art in that field (though at the time wasn't), got an A for his appreciation and my good teaching, and in all honesty, though I like Sree, did did more teaching than learning in this class I had to take by my earlier professor's bad faith. Systems is my least favorite field, but Sree's Parallel and Distributed Systems class, a different class, was the first and only systems class I ever liked-->. 

<!--So in other words I was coerced to take a class that turned out okay because I "got to" teach it with a professor I liked from yet a different systems class, because a different systems professor fell on the fence of deciding I had to do a semester of more grad-level systems work due to that ~0.1 fraction of a point and not believing my efforts to make the case that my own research would involve systems work, after our meeting. I mention this though because it recurs again many semesters later when my research ended up having to involve novel systems research due to new committee member's suggestions, that I did, that went unappreciated even worse than my argument to the B- one that my research later would (see ["Chris Kanan"](#chris-kanan)).-->

Sree introduced me to [Piazza](#kids), which is a great educational tool.

And in Spring, 2020, I worked in the office at the Med Center as my brain was just barely entering the first vestiges of recovery. I was [coming into the Med Center office regularly, working on the disease prognostication data and models on-site, and exercising again.](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/ShD9b4SeSA9Ebzbq/) 

### Termination Likely if Actual Medical Leave <!--At Least--> When Most Needed

<!--Had I taken a medical leave at the peak of this, and where the work was most intense, throughout the Spring, 2019 semester, I would've lost my salary, and wouldn't have been able to return for a long time, since the benzo brain damage was just getting started, in which case I most likely would've lost my health insurance, been delayed on [classes, TAship, and the area exam](5-Benzo-Torture.md)--><!-- (a many-page paper and oral defense, for which a master's degree is awarded, the biggest defense other than the thesis)--><!--, for yet another year at least (not to mention the time to write it), and, given [Henry's tenuous status having announced his intention to accept a directorship offer from the NSF](#red-light-at-clover-st), most likely would've been terminated for still having to do all of those things and not having an advisor, seeing as my next advisor, Chenliang, [would not have](#chenliang-xu) accepted me if I still had to do all of those things and had neither a published paper nor an area exam and resultant master's degree under my belt.--> <!--So taking a medical leave wasn't even an opportunity afforded me during the highest peak of the induced suffering by the same institution.-->

Had I taken a medical leave at the peak of this, and where the work was most intense, throughout the Spring, 2019 semester, I would've lost my salary, and wouldn't have been able to return for a long time, since the benzo brain damage was just getting started, in which case I most likely would've lost my health insurance, been delayed on all of this work, including the area exam, for yet another year at least (including the time to write it), and, given [Henry's tenuous status having announced his intention to accept a directorship offer from the NSF](#red-light-at-clover-st), most likely would've been terminated for not having an advisor.

Actually, *termination all but guaranteed if medical leave at any point*. Chenliang would later accept me into his group, after Henry left, on the condition that I submit a top-venue Computer Vision conference paper by the end of that summer. I would never have been able to do that if I didn't build on my interaction effects work at the Medical Center during this benzo torture period, working, that I later [transferred to Computer Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08601) to meet his requirement.

Also, it's improbable Chenliang would have accepted somebody else's student without a published top-venue Computer Vision conference paper while that student was also still behind an area exam, and that's an independent reason to the first for why I couldn't have taken a medical leave during the benzo trauma. Not taking a medical leave was necessary during the early and remainder period of the benzo trauma.

I would've lost the opportunity permanently for a PhD if I took a medical leave.

> [!NOTE]
> ### Buffy
>
> In high school, I loved Lost, and Community, and Better Off Ted, and at some point Reaper, a show no one's heard of<!-- (well, I guess Reaper was middle school)--> (oh, and while going back to middle school, also Heroes). But my favorite-favorite has been Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which at the time was available on Netflix. I was obsessed.<!--, as well as with [Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog](https://youtu.be/Of9kHpCv1ts?si=FPBQagGV-MX0BOK4).-->
>
> Almost nobody heard of Buffy in my high school, 2009 - 2013, Golden Age Peak TV era. I had a debate with my friend, another film buff, where I claimed TV shows were better than movies. He didn't believe me yet. In my high school, all those TV shows were getting missed<!--, at least by many of the people I talked to-->. Buffy had been out since the 90s/early 2000s, and was the most—maybe universally at my high school—unappreciated.
>
> The first person who took my recommendation got through multiple seasons, on my repeated insistence, and still didn't like it.
>
> It wasn't until my senior year I met somebody who liked Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I met him because he commented on a friend's Facebook post about a totally different shared interest, and I messaged him, he wanted to hang out to my surprise, and then he invited me to his birthday party. There, I met other kids who went to his school, including the other Buffy fan I met in high school, one of his friends who walked right up to me with a big smile and was so enthusiastic about my Buffy love. 
>
> Two of the first friends I made in college, by extreme coincidence, loved nerdy shows, especially Joss Whedon shows and Buffy, and were the <!-- girls--> people in my neighboring dorm. One of them later told me she didn't like Buffy that much. Her girlfriend however was such a big Buffy fan that she even made me feel guilty for not knowing some trivia about one of the episodes. The other one was one of the only people I ever watched Buffy together with. They both became my best friends that semester and I half-lived in their dorm. The other dorm near ours also housed <!--a girl--> someone who liked Buffy a lot, by chance. I was roomed near them by the university's random selection. Extreme Buffy fandom wasn't *that* common in college.
>
> Buffy appreciation, quite honestly, was how I measured intelligence then. Wealth and higher education, though, also seemed to increase likelihood of Buffy fandom, but not so as to without further Buffy-factor predict intelligence. It was a big surprise to me to meet those people in the private school, and then more people in college, with an appreciation for the shows I appreciated. It was literally surreal.
>
> I was so nervous with the first group, and regret missing the chance to bond more with them. The second group didn't make sense to me, but I was surrounded, and there was no escape from the universe giving me a good social life.
>
> From college to PhD, I didn't know Henry's favorite show was Buffy.
> 
> I was accepted as his PhD student not knowing that. I found out two semesters into the PhD program, and was kind of shocked. He said he was "obsessed with" Buffy, which he added is "kind of weird." I dropped off my "Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Philosophy: Fear and Trembling in Sunnydale" book, with a kind note, in his mailbox as a gift, re-gifting it from my best friend.
>
> Henry had a rare taste for something that others hadn't heard of as much, that would later contribute to the creation of something everybody has heard of. Joss Whedon created Buffy, and later wrote The Avengers, exploding from esoteric-nerdom to Blockbuster-God-man to cancelled-bad-man. Interestingly, Henry quipped and talked in a way reminiscent to Joss Whedon, and had theater writing experience, though as my advisor, Henry was more like Giles, Buffy's Watcher (advisor). Similarly, the method that I had a rare appreciation for, MHDPA, that had gone on to transformer-roll-out into being ChatGPT, would, much like Marvel movies, destroy civilization.
>
> Back in high school, all the best shows got cancelled, for which Joss Whedon was notorious, because of Firefly. So, so as to distinguish both of us from bad movie execs and producers, I am adding this paragraph just to say that I am not cancelling Henry.


Henry, who at the time was the Director for the Institute of Data Science at the University of Rochester, got an offer to be the Director of AI at the National Science Foundation, which is an extremely, extremely, extra-prestigious role. So he accepted, initially advised me while directing at the NSF in Washington, DC, after about half a year started planning to give up being my advisor, reassured me that his knowledge of deep learning specifically wasn't good enough anyway, and instructed me to switch to Chenliang Xu as my next advisor, who gave me an ultimatum about joining.

<!--
Compared the threat of AI to thinking about "traffic regulation on Mars"

"Traffic regulation on mars" quote can frame how that’s what Henry’s NSF directorship job in DC was, while he neglected to see through his final student to the completion of his degree. 
-->

Henry thought Chenliang would be better due to his having more experience in deep learning, but may have overestimated how much any professor at our CS department could afford me in terms of anything related to research and methods. Chenliang, for example, who was working on state of the art Computer Vision, had about as much familiarity with MHDPA in 2020 as Dan Gildea had in 2018, perhaps a little more. Before I was his student, in 2020, I presented using MHDPA on image features as an encoder architecture for Semantic Segmentation to him, on his whiteboard, with an explanatory diagram in my journal for what MHDPA was that I showed him, and a diagram on the whiteboard for my proposed Semantic Segmentation method. Chenliang, as many Computer Vision professors didn't, didn't know much, if <!--at all-->anything, what MHDPA was until Vision Transformers gained popularity in 2021.

Chenliang's real contribution was having GPUs, something I missed the deadline for while under Henry, as I had been given access to the NSF's for my honorable mention in the GRFP I applied to, but only if I made an account within a specified time window, right in the middle of my benzo withdrawal, that I missed.

I managed to publish 2 papers under Chenliang. <!--The number of papers published by Henry's--> Henry's average student paper count was 1 - 3 across the PhD student's full 5 - 7 years. 
<!--
Chenliang had no other problems or qualms with me, the second professor to abandon his advising responsibility, this time with far less justification, seeing as Henry believed it would be best for me to have an advisor with deep learning experience, and had a stated intention, though unverified, to fund me himself if all else failed.
-->

Until Henry's retirement in 2022, which he didn't warn me about and came to me as a surprise from Chenliang, he stayed on as my PhD committee member.

To this day, Henry hasn’t acknowledged that what I was arguing to him about, had implemented, and had innovated on in 2018—MHDPA, the method that underpins transformers such as those used in <!--AI models like--> ChatGPT—was worth crediting me for to any of the other faculty, committee members, or future committee members, including those who exploited my work or ruled me negatively in the years to come. And while that wouldn't be an issue had he been oblivious to what followed, he isn't. The exploitation and rulings to come are all in his knowledge. Though he recently retired, it's not that hard to reply to an email chain and write, "Wow, our student was incredibly right!" or something <!--meaningfully crediting me-->to that effect, to at least give me some credit from the University of Rochester, given the huge foresight and work delivered to him by his own student before even 5 groups in the world had used the method, let alone every iPhone and AI research lab and AI foundation model, as has become the case now.

> ### MHDPA Summary
>
> 17 days after I was and the day before my birthday, Sam Altman was terminated as the head of OpenAI, the company credited for ChatGPT, the thing that used MHDPA, the method that I was the 5th "group" in the world to ever use, before every iPhone, foundation model, and AI research group in the world now does, and first in the world/history to ever innovate on, except as a single PhD student. And those other 4 "groups" were all DeepMind, whereas I was in an environment where everybody was oblivious to the value. My name is Sam Lerman. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, was terminated 17 days after I was, one day before my birthday, for working on an AGI research area that is pretty specifically close to my specialized research area (though shortly rehired after). The reason my paper wasn’t published as I found out from email record, is apparently Henry discouraged me from submitting my paper to the full conference in 2018, truncated my paper down to 3 pages, and got me to submit to a small workshop in April, 2019, at which point I was benzo brain damaged and extremely insecure about every perception and belief I had. I used his version exactly, even though mine’s really better, by far; it got rejected — not even for good reasons, but because the reviewers thought I was proposing MHDPA itself, not having heard of it previously, yes the method that underpins ChatGPT, and rejected MHDPA on account of it being, uh, too similar to different attention mechanisms from before MHDPA — yes, in other words, my paper was rejected because the reviewers thought I invented MHDPA — and after/concurrent with that I was literally brain damaged and then had to switch into Computer Vision under an extremely oppressive deadline from Chenliang, and by the time I could’ve done anything voluntarily, MHDPA ("transformers") were already commonplace, popularized, standardized, and actively revolutionizing the field<!--, haha-->. So, I had quite a flagpole that only email record now documents. I would laugh, but it's pretty tragic. Coincidentally — sorry, one more synchronicity — CMT, the company owned by the same company that owns the company Sam Altman is in charge of, OpenAI, Microsoft — deleted all record of conference submissions a week before my termination! They sent out a mass email. So, that workshop paper Henry got me to submit in April after having "discouraged" (his email documented words) me from submitting to the full conference in 2018 the previous year, had all traces deleted in October, 2023, a week before I was terminated, as reported to everybody by mass email. And the only record left that any of what I’m writing is true is in Henry and another professor’s email inbox, meaning — maybe — a lot of faith is needed in me to make anything about me systemically credible. The end. BUT, on top of that, I really appreciated Henry, so I win the emotional debate too — like disproportionately appreciated him as he discouraged me from the work I did, left as an advisor, and has since ignored all of my emails.

## Stuck in Traffic

The bigger red light, is that Wendi Heinzelman and Nick Vamivakas, were filled in on all of what reasonably can be summarized, or should've been my emails to them, Michael, and the faculty sent, including the medical malpractices (in less-than-book form) and what follows. They didn't reply to my emails or address me directly. [I did my best to explain everything](../3-Formal-Disproof/2-They-Didn't-Know.md). Formally, it was their responsibility most. To ignore a PhD student sending emails en masse summarizing medical trauma inflicted by the university and workers injuries is an extreme administration malpractice.

<!--
The bigger red light, is that Dean Wendi Heinzelman should've been filled in on all of what happened. I sent an [email](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Not-Enough-Carbs.md) about all of the medical malpractices that I asked to be shared, and [CC'd her](3-Disproof.md#email-10302023) on almost all of my emails after the subsequent events. She didn't respond. She ignored. Those emails are lying in her inbox. Dean Nick Vamivakas received [even more](3-Disproof.md#10302023---10312023-and-7-years-ago---now) emails than her, and did not address me either. Upwards of 13 independent medical malpractices, and starting from the next chapter, workers abuse injuries, all of which did not seem sufficiently believable to them in the state of agitated panic I sent them in, "flying colors" perhaps deemed deficient.

> ### Incremental 2018
>
> The paper Henry discouraged me from submitting didn't change by a single word from the 2018 version by the time he believed it was ready to be submitted to NeurIPS in 2019.
> 
> I didn’t have the cognitive functioning to edit it beyond the submission from late 2018 that Henry rejected. 
>
> I submitted Henry's workshop paper earlier in 2019 and then my original paper to NeurIPS, by which point most people today think MHDPA was ubiquitous and well known in NLP, and the paper was rejected — for a laughable reason — it seemed none of the reviewers heard of MHDPA, at least one of the reviewers thought I was proposing MHDPA, *compared it to a different attention mechanism from before MHDPA*, and at least that one rejected on account of rejecting MHDPA, while the others rejected, I think, for not enough experiments.
> 
> In 2024, I deserve better, having done the work alone, in an environment where everybody discouraged me, 6 years ago, before more than even 4 groups in the world/history had used MHDPA, let alone every iPhone, foundation model, and AI research lab, and none in the world/history had innovated new methods on it. 2018-sort-of-incremental-improvement-to-MHDPA is much more valuable to a terminated PhD student than 2024 of that. And whether the improvement  is incremental is not obvious, since compared to other innovations that have garnered popularity since, it’s actually more intricate. To summarize it to Henry in early 2020, to boil it down, I described effectively Google’s Sparse Attention (2022) but in 2020, so even that was still original, since that’s somewhat less technically involved to boil down for Henry. If it sounds like I’m idea impoverished, I have more than enough executed ideas that are still revolutionary and novel today, and have implemented [UnifiedML](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder) primarily [since 2021](6-Opposing-Views.md), which — if were allowed to be finalized — includes a framework that can be used to train better models than ChatGPT, as well as real-time RL robotics, and more, so I can't without support, and the good method I implemented and submitted to Henry’s rejection in 2018 isn’t my priority, only a major evidence that the University of Rochester has taken a mountain of love and credit from me, for nothing — years of what could've been frontier progress taken by medical malpractice and doubt — that my new committee members thought I had to do more, effectively rejecting [UnifiedML](6-Opposing-Views.md#unifiedml), and [XRD project](6-Opposing-Views.md#niaz-abdolrahim), even as advisor Chenliang and PI Niaz (who oversaw the XRD project in the Mechanical Engineering department) wrote or said I was ready to defend.

> In 2018, I built on top of a DeepMind Sonnet implementation of a transformer, there being no standardized infrastructures in 2018 for transformers, my MHDPA innovation in TensorFlow 1.x. TensorFlow was still declarative, and extremely inconvenient compared to how PyTorch and TensorFlow are imperative today. In 2018, I had to program Gumbel Softmax in TensorFlow 1.x myself, possibly the first ever to do so.

<!--But it's not just a question of how much progress I made in 2018, but how much progress I would've made if not for the induced debilitation in the middle of it, that lasted more than a year, and which wasn't interupted until after Henry left, and I was already forced onto new work, to meet Chenliang's additional demands.-->
