## My Grandma's Hair, Nails, and Dementia

### Childhood

### $\Huge &#8220;$
*Moscow was bombed every day, sometimes multiple times a day. 500 airplanes bombed the city in one day. Not only bombs, but also a lot of lighters were thrown from the airplanes. The alarm of the air raid required everyone to step down to the underground [bomb shelters], and I went there too. But if the air raid came at the time of our work shift, we, all working at the armory [defense factory], children*<!-- [children working at the defense factory]-->*, climbed on the roof. Our responsibility was to take the hot lighters and throw them off the roof, to prevent a fire.*

&ensp;&ensp; - Translated to English by my mom from an interview with my grandma that my mom did for MCC, in October, 2000. Brackets denote my edits.

My grandma was 13 and my great aunt Tsilia was 18. Their dad was fighting in the war front. Their mother had died when my grandma was 5 and her sister was 10, from typhus. Their step mother was sick with tuberculosis; and their little younger step-brother Yura, 10 years younger than my grandma, was too young to help with throwing the fire bombs.

<!--
My grandma was about 24 when she and my grandpa (different Yura) arrived to Samarkand.  She was a German language teacher, before my uncle was born. She didn't know German, but she knew Yiddish, so she accepted the job, since Yiddish is close to German. Later, she was a teacher of Russian language and Russian literature, separate fields. Later, she was an academic principal of a school and continued teaching.

### Nails

My grandma was about 24 when she and my grandpa (different Yura) had to immigrate to Samarkand.  She was a German language teacher, before my uncle was born. She didn't know German, but she knew Yiddish, so she accepted the job, since Yiddish is close to German. Later, she was a teacher of two separate fields, Russian language, and literature, and later, an academic principal of a school and continued teaching.

At old age, she had long grey hair, down to even her waist or hips. She curled it up behind her head, in a very elegant/pretty bun, with hair pins.

I inherited my mom's hair, who inherited my grandma's hair.

<!--My grandma had long grey hair, down to almost her waist or hips. She curled it up behind her head with hair pins, like in a bun but prettier.-->

In addition to losing all of my hair — head, eyebrows, and eyelashes — due to the Dupilumab cessation, my eczema temporarily spiked and I lost my fingernails in functionality in later 2018, also unambiguously due to the Dupilumab cessation. They regrew, healthily functional enough, after being purple, and bendy like putty, for a really long time, maybe into 2019. 

`Additional side effects included temporarily worsened eczema, and fingernails turning purple and bending like putty.`

My grandma actually told me I had her nails. I even remember where. But I also have her eyes, and my mom's eyes, brown eyes. But, randomly, my grandma mentioned it, about my nails, when we were sitting in the backseat of the car. My mom and grandpa were in the front seats. My mom was probably driving us to the Jewish Community Center, to swim in the community pool there. My grandma saw my fingers and just mentioned that I had her nails, unusual.

Without hair, without eyebrows and eyelashes, with even my grandma's fingernails purple and bending out of my nails, and isolation and heavy workloads, just what I needed was a >6 months course of benzos to get all the symptoms of early-onset dementia.

### The Probable Cause of My Grandma's Dementia

For me, this was a mercy. She was like a mother to me and losing her to dementia was like the most gradual way to lose her. 

Benzos [contribute to the likelihood of dementia in elderly people](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6325366/).

My grandma was prescribed a cocktail of neuroactive drugs before she had dementia. Seroquel, Lyrica, Xanax, and the brochure goes on. She didn't have any of the conditions those medications are primarily supposed to treat (Seroquel is an antipsychotic, Lyrica is an antiepileptic, Xanax is a benzo), and every time she developed a new symptom from one, they prescribed yet another. She developed dementia when I was still in high school. She lived with dementia from then to my Junior year of college, the same year my grandpa died, 2016.

She was always smiling, all through her dementia, kind, even in her last days.

<!--
That semester I was dating somebody who told me something about my nails. My grandma actually told me I had her nails. I even remember where. But I also have her eyes, and my mom's eyes, brown eyes. But, randomly, my grandma mentioned it, about my nails, when we were sitting in the backseat of the car. My mom and grandpa were in the front seats. My mom was probably driving us to the Jewish Community Center, to swim in the pool there. My grandma saw my fingers and just mentioned that I had her nails, unusual, but something I'm proud of.

In 2016, the semester she died, someone I was dating made an even more unusual remark about my nails.

## How My Grandpa Died

### Lyubimey V'nuk

When I was a kid, I listed off my favorite family members once, in my order of favorite, in front of all of them who were in our apartment living room, either standing or eating at the table. Maybe I was 5 or so. I remember they all looked big and I was standing. Grandpa was sitting in his bigger chair at the table and I started, "Babula" ("Grandma"), "Máma," "Marina," ... and then after all the others who I listed, I listed my grandpa. I still remember that. He wasn't offended, and I love and loved my grandpa a lot. In maybe 16 years, I would be standing by his bedside in the hospital, after a heart surgery he had, when he'd tell me: "Ti moy lyubimey v'nuk" ("You are my favorite grandson."). He has 4 grandkids: Irina, Lena, Marina, and me. I'm his only grandson... 

I remember sitting by my grandpa's bedside, alternating days and nights. My mom or I were needed there at all times. He was almost 88, and the languages he spoke were Russian, Ukrainian, and Yiddish, and he was legally blind. He and I couldn't watch the same TV when he lived with us, because he neither spoke English nor could see, but sometimes when I visited my grandma's and his apartment unit immediately across from ours (after they'd moved, since originally we lived together), we watched Russian Television Network together, and they actually got some Cable channels from the government program, as well. In my apartment, we only had ABC, FOX, NBC, CBS, and PBS. Then we also got an additional channel, the CW. With high school and college, I had, uh, resourcefulness, and Netflix. During those days and nights at his bedside in the hospital, in the hospital recliner chair next to him, I watched a lot of Doctor Who on Netflix on my laptop, a show about an alien with two hearts called The Doctor that resurrects after each death, the previous generation surviving in the next, and the next, and the next. It's the [longest running science fiction show in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who#:~:text=The%20series%20has%20been%20listed,ratings%2C%20DVD%20and%20book%20sales.), a show that originally started with an old grandpa.

### Surgery

My grandpa survived two heart attacks previously, one in Uzbekistan and one in America. 

Here is how he ended up in the hospital: Sometime in the month of November, in 2015, he was having trouble breathing, my mom took him to his primary care doctor, she diagnosed him with congestive heart failure, she prescribed pills, then about a month and a week of taking pills later, he was still having trouble breathing, my mom took him to the hospital, they took a blood analysis, and apparently he'd had a third heart attack, that occurred about a week before. So my grandpa's heart doctor came into the hospital, recommended a stent be put in my grandpa's heart's main artery, via a surgery, and that the surgery would use an angiogram. The angiogram would require a dye that is bad for the kidneys. The primary care physician wanted to discharge my grandpa and send him for rehabilitation already, without the surgery; the heart doctor told my mom "without the surgery, his heart would only get worse" and that "he'd only have heart attacks and eventually die," so my mom chose to listen to the heart doctor, they did the angiogram, they tried to do the surgery, but the main artery was completely blocked, the surgeon wasn't able to do the surgery so put stents into the little arteries that were narrow but weren't the cause of the congestive heart failure, and right after the impromptu-alternative-surgery, which required an angiogram, which used the dye that was bad for the kidneys, my grandpa's kidneys got so bad he couldn't walk at all anymore; he couldn't stand up on his feet.

I was visiting him on alternating nights before and after the surgery. Then, after the New Year 2016, the hospital didn't know what do with him, discharged him, and sent him to the Jewish home for rehabilitation, for physical therapy to help with his worsened kidneys. They also scheduled a follow-up appointment with his heart doctor in that heart doctor's private office, separate from both the hospital and Jewish home, in a different location from either, for January 21, 2016.

### Transit

My grandpa was a self-reliant man, but the transit two weeks later on January 21, 2016 from the Jewish home to that heart doctor's office was extreme. My mom was there, and it was a big ordeal just to help him stand amid the kidney problems that were causing him difficulty moving. How big a toll that transfer of locations took: they resorted to using an elevating machine that lifted him, an almost 88 year old man, up from his bed. 

"Why was he discharged from the hospital?" the heart doctor had asked at that appointment in his office. "In this condition, he should be in the hospital."

My grandpa's heart failed that night, after the grueling trial to make the heart doctor appointment, in all likelihood because of that grueling trial. His official death was the night of that heart doctor appointment, January 22, 2016.

My grandpa was not one to miss a grueling transit. On July 3, 1941, my grandpa, his mom Maná, and his younger sister Rosá evacuated Ukraine. They went place to place by train, lived in different places, worked at farms. Once, they took the train from Rostov, and the train stopped. My grandpa was young, maybe 14. He thought, "I'll go to the market nearby and buy something." He bought a little bit of bread and kielbasa. When he came back, he discovered his train already left. So he asked people. They said, "There's a place where those trains stop. You can go there and take another train; they go the same direction, so maybe you can catch up with your previous train," and he saw, one train had already started moving, one train there on that platform, already in motion, and he decided he could jump, so he jumped. He was holding on, but he was gonna fall, and he thought he was gonna fall under the train. But there was someone who picked him up, quickly pulled him on (elevated him onto this big mechanical machine), someone on that train, someone who was there who quickly pulled him up. He ended up making it to their previous train's destination before his mom and sister, waiting for them, as theirs which had more stops in their transit's journey, arrived after him.

This time, my grandpa arrived a little before my grandma, despite being a little younger, in the same year, just a few months before.

In Uzbekistan, it was custom for doctors to visit patients. Physicians always came to patient homes, or wherever the patient was, standardly, in Uzbek healthcare. But America and Uzbekistan had something in common, regarding their healthcare systems: cardiologists (heart doctors) specifically, didn't visit patient homes. In our neighboring apartment units, my grandpa was having trouble breathing, but could still walk, and had survived three heart attacks previous to his death. Perhaps the heart doctor was right, and he'd keep having heart attacks and eventually die, but eventually was the night of their appointment, after a heroic ordeal to get to that office that my grandpa, with heavy strain, survived, and made it back in time to the Jewish home for his final destination, earlier than had he never gotten off the first train for some bread and kielbasa.

## When My Grandma Died

### Food

My grandma, Asya Lerman (Hebrew/American: "Esya") always cooked, healthy and really well, but she had type-2 diabetes at old age.
I remember, for herself, she had to use artificial sweeteners because she couldn't eat pure sugar.
She also made these delicious Russian cookies for us called "Korshike," that I loved, that she also put into these different mold shapes, hearts and stars and fish and circles. I liked to eat the raw dough sometimes, but she didn't let me eat it in large quantities because of eggs and the risk of salmonella.

I had healthier food than the average American as a kid — plov, cabbage stews, potato stews, salads, katleti, tefteli, borscht, pelmeni — despite my family's poverty, but I still had eczema, allergies, and asthma through my whole childhood.

My grandma taught my mom dancing when they were younger, in Uzbekistan. Seeing my grandpa bedridden in the hospital, even before the surgery, it was obvious to me that he was losing strength, just from the sedentary confinement to bed, that the doctors put him in, in a corner of a concrete-surrounded hospital, with no natural light, nature, or fresh air. He would've benefited from some motion, out of bed and walking, outdoors, with nature, with fresh air. At least once a day, each day, without any grueling transits to reach such an environment.

I really think had the hospital recommended my grandpa an organic steak/salmon-only diet, and nothing more, they possibly could've saved his main artery from being blocked, without a surgery. Then no stents would be put into his healthier narrow arteries, no damaged kidneys, no grueling transit to heart doctor. Just physical therapy and rehabilitation. And maybe many more years, living beyond my grandma.

### Numerical Timings

She shortly outlived my grandpa, and died the same year as him **three days before** his April 16 birthday, on April 13, 2016.

I suppose she'd've had to forestall her death as well, then, seeing she died just a few months after he died, in the same year, as if on purpose, joining him exactly 3 days before his April 16 birthday, on April 13, 2016, where 13 both symbolizes a death kind of day and has the number 3, as in 3 days before, and 2016 has the number 16, the upcoming day of my grandpa's birthday.

She couldn't have died on a more perfect day, except if my grandpa lived a many, many years longer.

My grandpa also gets two claims to rhythmic numerical timing: (1) He entered the hospital on December 22, 2015, spent two weeks in the hospital, two weeks in the Jewish home, and then died exactly a month after, on January 22, 2016, (2) He, Yury Lerman, was born "Izya"; but during the war, as documents were lost and "Izya" was a Jewish name amid an extremely anti-semitic Ukraine, he called himself "Yura," or the full name, "Yury," and that became his new name with the new documents when he was about 16, the same age (16 again) as my name was officially changed to "Sam" actually, by amazing ancestral-but-unintended rhyme.

Now for some stretchier synchronicities:

As for my grandma, the number 13 also includes a number that "is less than 3," e.g. a heart <3, which a modern readership might be able to visually appreciate universally across languages, having been a teacher of varied languages, including Ukrainian, Russian, Yiddish, and German (and she also learned English after we immigrated), in her life.

Besides 16, another synchronistic number is 7. My grandma was born March 25, 1927. My mom was born July 17, 1957 (07/17/57). And <!--my cousin--> Irina, who takes the most from my grandma besides me, was born November 17, one day and 6 years apart from my birthday. And my grandpa was 87 when he died.

And 2016 has the number 16, that, besides being the upcoming day of my grandpa's birthday, was the beginning of a larger-scope revolution in politics, and reformed perceptions of the healthcare system, with the 2016 ascent of another, similar Jewish old-grandpa type character and role model to me, Bernie Sanders, who has some similarities to my grandpa. 

My grandma's numerical timing of when she died is a proof symbol in my opinion on the perception and characterized message of my grandpa's death involving the heart doctor seeming synchronistic: that the healthcare system needs reform. And the ascent of Bernie, whose name slantly rhymes with "Yury," synchronized in tune, means a lot to me about the need for reforming healthcare systems, not just in governance, but inside the systems themselves, from elderly care, to prescription habits, to the dietary and environment principles. 

### Massages

I had severe eczema, and my grandma, mom, and grandpa when I was a kid helped by giving the best massages. My grandma's were the best of the best of theirs.

Psyche may have symbolically pointed to one more aspect of the medical system that might need a revolutionary radical innovation, one that will be discussed, succinctly, later… (see ["Intimacy healing"](#intimacy-healing)).

## Ascent of a Jewish old grandpa

I’d heard about Bernie Sanders from reading about him on Facebook, and I met some supporters who’d even heard of him before his 2015 - 2016 presidential run. I was getting his campaign emails, it was still early in his campaign before the 2016 Democratic primaries, and I told my mom about him, that I wanted to donate from the link in a campaign email from him. She was worried, thinking it might be spam.

That wasn’t implausible, that a politician who her son is describing as actually caring about policies, with principles, who calls himself a "socialist" and is Jewish, and is making serious headway as a contender for the office of president in America, is some kind of trick.

It didn’t take long before she could see he was a serious and sincere "politician," and the word "politician" has to go in quotes, because Bernie’s "politics" are about actual governing.

My mom donated to him, too.

"Bernie Sanders" is a household name today, so much so that some people might roll their eyes, call me a "Bernie bro." But unlike the "Bernie bros" across the Democratic party leadership who have taken on his positions and rhetoric, without giving credit to the fact that they actively stood opposed to those very positions and rhetoric when Bernie was still bringing those views into the mainstream all his life, I’m a [Bernie "supporter,"](https://github.com/slerman12/Governance/blob/main/Does-Nature-Endorse%3F.md) not bro.

Those ideas, like Medicare For All, a $15 minimum wage, ending the corruption of Wall St., acknowledging the huge gap between "the top 1% and the 99%," have become popular talking points thanks to his campaigns (though the non-Bernie talking heads often leave out public funding of elections and overturning Citizens United), which made a bigger difference in American political knowledge and culture than any of the Democrats who campaigned against him, including the one who became president.

I don’t want to echo what has already been taught, and taught effectively, in both 2015/2016 and 2019/2020. This book requires an open mind because it points out issues and reforms that aren’t redundant to the ones Bernie has pointed out, in contexts that may seem familiar to one side or another ("Oh he's anti-medicine!", "Oh he's anti-science!", "Oh he's part of the 'woke mob'!"), but aren't.
