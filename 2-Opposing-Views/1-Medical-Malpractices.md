## Severe Eczema Since a Month and a Half, Infancy

From just a month and a half old, I had severe eczema. It wasn’t something I could escape. The itchiness overwhelmed me, and my tiny infant hands couldn’t stop scratching—scratching until my skin bled, as my mom described. It was endless. I cried, scratched, and cried some more. My mom, desperate to help, put me in a baby’s shirt with mittens sewn onto the sleeves, trying to stop the scratching, trying to stop me from hurting myself.

By the time I was two or three, a family friend named Shafkad told my mom about a man—a healer living far away in a village. He wasn’t a doctor, but a kind of shaman, someone who might have a cure. My mom agreed to go. Shafkad drove us to this far-off village, which looked different from where we lived—"looking-uncivilized-village," my mom described, in the sense that it seemed ancient, rustic.

When we arrived, a man came out, someone Shafkad knew, and he told my mom, "I’ll take him to the healer. No, you stay here."

My mom wanted to come along, but the man wouldn’t allow it. "No. You not allowed." Maybe because she was a woman, and this was a Muslim village. 

She hesitated, but Shafkad reassured her. "No, no. They’re good people. They heal."

And so, reluctantly, she stayed behind. I went.

After about twenty minutes, they brought me back. The man who had taken me returned with the healer. He was a short, middle-aged man—maybe in his 40s or 50s—who looked Uzbek or perhaps Tajik.

The healer looked at my mom and said, "Sorry. I couldn’t. I don’t know how to. I couldn’t help your son. I don’t know how to fix it." That was it. He didn’t accept payment. "I couldn’t heal him. I can’t."

Before we left, the healer spoke again. "Are you going to America? Maybe they can heal him there. They have better doctors."

My mom didn’t know how he knew about our plans to immigrate, if Shafkad had told him or how.

And so we left. I didn’t leave healed, but the shaman was genuine in reinforcing hope for my mom regarding the unknown abilities of the doctors in America. The shaman may have also spoken of demons, attempting to rid me of them—perhaps successfully—though he could do nothing for the eczema.

My mom recounted this memory [in an interview recently](link to interview). 

## Foreboding Electric Razor 

My grandpa gave me his electric razor when I was in high school. It was the first razor I ever had and the only one I'd ever used through high school and college.

In the 2017 summer, before I started the eczema medication Dupilumab, my mom and I celebrated my graduation from college ("uni," in European-speak) by going to Europe, and my razor broke in the luggage.

In high school, I had always talked of Finland in my arguing points with the Republicans of my school, referring to it for its social safety net programs and specifically that it's ranked highest in the world's happiness index. That was a point I made a lot, a go-to point in my political debates, since happiness is a good measure of a country's wellbeing.

In the summer 2017, after graduation, my mom and I went to Finland. I had no idea I'd ever have the opportunity. I had no idea we knew relatives there. 

My electric razor—from my grandpa—had broken in the luggage. There, I had to borrow somebody else's related to my grandpa, who [like me](link me at grandpa's funeral) and my grandpa when he was younger, inherited some [good, spikeable hair](link some photos of my grandpa).

## Premonition or Omen

Here begins the story of how my hair fell out.

That summer 2017, immediately *at the head* (pun noticed, but not overly intended) of my first year as a PhD student, my university-hospital doctor Lisa Beck prescribed a medication called Dupilumab. It's a biologic agent that is injected into the stomach on a regular basis and laser-targets a specific antibody in the body system-wide associated with eczema. 

By the way, the scariest nightmare I ever had, over and over that whole night, was the night of the day I injected Dupilumab the first time, that summer after the prescription. I remember my housemate at the time in the other room and I wanted to wake him. That's how scared I was. The nightmare was of a tall skinny slenderman, who kept approaching to "assault" me. Every time I closed my eyes and fell asleep, he'd reappear. Again and again, for that whole night. I never had a nightmare like that before. It was vivid.

## House on May St.

My hair fell out while I lived in my *house on May St.*, a miraculous situation where the landlord—who I'd never met previously—rented me a 4-bedroom nice antique house near both the university and the park in Rochester where the Lilac Festival is held, to myself, for $600/month, starting Fall, 2017—well, technically one bedroom from that house, but I had the whole place to myself pretty much for the next year, and even furnished at least one other bed from another room since, inexplicably and literally miraculously, the landlord didn't believe he could find anyone on his own without my help to rent out to, and he wanted grad students. 

It was beautiful, and even had a porch and balcony, big kitchen, a freezer for big-game hunting (this detail becomes funny later), basement, dishwasher, and laundry machine. Of some of the PhD students who visited me, some needed housing, and later the landlord and I showed them around the rooms (maybe not even prior to me furnishing any of the other bedrooms, which the landlord didn't mind that I'd done, seeing as my best friend and I also beautifully furnished that whole house together during one of my best friend's visits early when I moved in, really beautifully, and that increased the value of the house more, in addition to the sofa and tables and furnishings and beds and desks that the landlord provided—did I mention the word "miraculous" yet?), and one of them even mentioned to the landlord at the end having the funds to pay the full year's rent already—I don't remember why they ended up not moving in, but that was also clearly miraculous. I did end up renting out the attic (which was like a studio apartment, well, a giant room) to one of my friends from high school for the landlord after maybe 4 months of having the place to myself, and even then it was pretty much entirely my house, though he also set up a DJ station for himself in the basement since he threw raves (not in the house), and had his girlfriend over, but he kept quiet, and he wasn't a grad student, but the landlord had a strong belief in my judgement again, miraculously so.

Pets weren't allowed, but that's okay, because there was a [semi-adopted stray who regularly came to visit me outside and sat with me on (or near) my porch named "Batman" (according to his collar)](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/KXoyjpZeM6tsKRrE/), and I loved him very much if the video doesn't make that clear.

Months before I moved out, I became the admin/moderator of the [university Facebook housing page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1112684565415024/) by chance, because the actual admin posted he was looking for a student to moderate the page for him, and I responded that I could do it. My landlord didn't know (and probably still doesn't) that I'm the effective-admin/moderator of that page. Also, since then, I've messaged the manager/admin of that group multiple times to give the moderation to someone else or moderate it himself and he hasn't replied, and doesn't appear to use Facebook, so hereforth I'm permitting myself to call myself the admin. I'm glad to moderate, but not super good at keeping up to date with it. So, after there was no chance left of getting to keep the place to just myself and friend longer, I ended up finding University of Rochester grad students to fill all 4 bedrooms of the house, and all 4 bedrooms of the neighboring house, also belonging to the landlord—I think "semi-detached home" is what it's called—and, thanks to the ad I ended up posting ([here it is](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbe5ceff-3b06-4582-97fb-c13c30d00564)), I redirected inquiries to my landlord's email and my landlord's email flooded with other PhD students looking to fill that house, including one of the ones who'd originally wanted and planned to who I'd notified (he moved into the attached one, closer to what was at the time an abandoned building and Highland Park). I ended up adding my landlord to that page, where, technically I'm not supposed to allow landlords, only students. Sorry for this phrasing, but the landlord's house is now "never lacking" in interested grad students looking to rent from him. In fact, lucky for him, the neighboring commercial building is now [a herbal apothecary](https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2019/09/19/little-apothecary-becomes-little-herbary-south-ave-rochester-ny/2365775001/), since it was abandoned when I lived there (due to, if I recall correctly, a murder, though I didn't know that moving in).

I also grew out a full beard <!--(except a really small patch probably from a lifetime of topical eczema creams, as my pediatrician told me was happening in high school or college)--> and full mustache mostly in those first months I lived in that May St. house, based on an independent Paleo-based intuition/principle. [Here's a picture with my family at that house from my 22nd birthday](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d1d366e-14bd-49cd-9a58-dca108e9a144), not too long after I started to grow it out. My best friend [visited me](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/c7m83bHR5v1mP4p4/) on December 15th, 2017 at that house and encouraged me to shave it (just before we went to a rave that day, the other friend's who would later move in with me, coincidentally), some months before Aetna cut me off from the prescription to Dupilumab, but it was the first time I ever grew out my facial hair.

I was working really hard in that house, developing my long-term memory research ideas and implementing the code for it there, meditating every day while practicing strict dietary (Paleo and organic) disciplines, practicing many asceticisms including not watching movies and TV shows, no unnatural lights after 8 PM except candlelight and always going to bed by 10 or 11, reading philosophy books (Jung, Campbell) and academic works for entertainment, cooking all of my food fresh (breaking from my diet, even while on Dupilumab, resulted in eczema), cold rather than hot showers (e.g., Wim Hof method), while working on campus taking full semesters of grad-level classes, and at the University of Rochester's Medical Center, building neural models to predict the progression of Parkinson's disease, and that house is where I started to get my idea for how stochasticity in the universe's quantum mechanics could explain a mechanism for "God" or some intelligent power in nature, hypothetically.

I was sleeping in one of the second bedrooms, when, on a rare occasion, my housemate friend and his girlfriend woke me climbing up the stairs. Somehow I had a sudden realization, near around 3 AM or whatever time it was in that night, that the universe's particles might be random, and therefore can be shifted by slight divergences by an intelligence—like the biological kind (or modeled by the artificial kind)—in such a way that still respects the known laws of physics and yet permits the possibility of an intelligent nature, that can modulate how those particles are sampled with respect to the sampling distributions.

In that house, somewhat before, and thereafter (continuing for years, mostly without pause), I was practicing many disciplines, including meditation, Paleo diet, and ascetic disciplines. I learned the Transcendental Meditation (TM) technique from an instructor, while living there. The instructor I learned from through the TM program was trained directly by the creator/translator of the technique, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the guru/yogi the Beatles infamously learned their meditation practice from. I experienced the subtle sinking/melting of my state of consciousness, including visceral physiological sensations, perhaps what some people have observed/called as "Kundalini," that I hadn't heard of yet and came to from Googling my physical sensations, that were a movement in my chest, back of neck/maybe esophagus/throat region, or into my third eye/lobe region, visceral and physical, and that I had full control of the motion of, in each axis direction of movement. The meditation brought my consciousness to a sublime state and alleviated my social anxiety.

<!--
Later, after some time without that "Kundalini" sensation, I described how I theorized TM might work to another skeptical PhD student, my friend Mohsen, who'd actually visited me in that house and met "Batman" once, but on a hiking/camping/kayaking/hotel trip much later in the Adirondacks and Niagra Falls, that it had something to do with the distribution of processing systems in the brain. For example: attenuating to a mantra, reduces other area attention activity such that unconscious thinking processes can be allocated. However, while still in the house on May St., I had a different philosophy, involving my physical body, as well as associative and long-term memory— but I can't remember what it was. I have notes in a small red journal (not a reference to Jung's "Red Book," but I was reading Jung at the time) [here](). To do: find journal and link photos
-->

<!--
The beard had a really small bald patch similar to places on my body where my skin was very smooth that my pediatrician (who I was still seeing in my Freshman year of college) diagnosed while I was a Freshman in college as probably due to the use of prescribed topical creams for eczema on those parts of my body. My chin is one of those areas where I got eczema and had applied those creams through high school and college. My head, eyelashes, armpits, and pubic area weren't.

It was in that house when Aetna cut me off from Dupilumab and my hair started falling out.

## University of Rochester Induced Hair Loss <!--(*fellowship with man*)-->

Some time into taking the medication—I think maybe 8 months—my university-provided health insurance Aetna **cut me off from the drug without warning. I wasn't notified by Aetna or my doctor, or the university-owned hospital**, but by the university-owned intermediary deliverer around the scheduled delivery date, who was responsible for delivering the drug on a recurring basis to my doorstep, since it can't—or at least at the time, due to it being a "specialty drug"—be provided for pick-up at a pharmacy. They called me and told me they couldn't reach my doctor: <!--for some reason-->without explanation Aetna had decided to no longer cover the prescription of the drug for me. 

`Aetna cut me off from Dupilumab, prescribed to me by the University of Rochester, about 8 months into my dependency without warning.`

`The deliverer didn't deliver it.`

`The deliverer couldn't reach my doctor.`

I remember walking up and down Mt. Hope Avenue with my phone in a panic calling my doctor trying to reach her, and the university deliverer telling me they were trying to do the same and couldn't reach her either. After a while, my hair started falling out rapidly. I have no genetic predisposition to baldness, from any side of my family. The abnormally rapid hair loss was obviously due to the dependency and cessation. 

`I couldn't reach my doctor.`

Though it fell out quickly, I didn't notice at first. The shower drains were filled with hair every day, and I thought it was maybe my housemate's girlfriend's. I didn't get to see my doctor until later in the summer (the soonest her office had scheduled it: August 14), a long time after, when I think much of the side and top of my head were bald. She diagnosed it as Alopecia Areata as a result of the sudden cessation of Dupilumab. To be clear, she diagnosed it as Alopecia Areata as a result of the sudden cessation<!-- of Dupilumab-->, and she and her nurse took pictures and stored them in the university-hospital computers. 

`I wasn't given the appointment with my doctor until months after.`
<!--`I wasn't given an appointment with my doctor until at least a month, maybe two months or more, after the missed injection.`-->

`The cessation initially caused Alopecia Areata.`

Eventually, she somehow sorted out things with the university-provided health insurance, but by then it was too late. Most of my hair had fallen out.

`The drug was delivered after I lost my hair.`

After that house, I moved in with my mom to our apartment, where I came up with my [MHDPA innovation paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qgmmzgsrctmg#6cd1b9) (the method underlying ChatGPT) in 2018, and it was in the middle of wrapping up that that I was hospitalized (no prior history). It was actually in the first hospitalization, at RGH (see ["Crisis"](PhD-Faculty-Malpractices-2.md/crisis)), where I ran the successful experiments for that paper, since the hospital staff had allowed my mom to bring in my laptop. It was in the second hospital, at the University of Rochester’s Strong Hospital (see ["The unsampled world at Clover St."](#the-unsampled-world-at-clover-st)), where I described relational reasoning to my brother-in-law and showed that paper to my fellow inpatient, Sarah (real name used with permission).
