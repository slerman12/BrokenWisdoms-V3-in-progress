> [!NOTE]
> ### Buffy
>
> In high school, I loved Lost, and Community, and Better Off Ted, and at some point Reaper, a show no one's heard of<!-- (well, I guess Reaper was middle school)--> (oh, and while going back to middle school, also Heroes). But my favorite-favorite has been Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which at the time was available on Netflix. I was obsessed.<!--, as well as with [Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog](https://youtu.be/Of9kHpCv1ts?si=FPBQagGV-MX0BOK4).-->
>
> Almost nobody heard of Buffy in my high school, 2009 - 2013, Golden Age Peak TV era. I had a debate with my friend, another film buff, where I claimed TV shows were better than movies. He didn't believe me yet. In my high school, all those TV shows were getting missed<!--, at least by many of the people I talked to-->. Buffy had been out since the 90s/early 2000s, and was the most—maybe universally at my high school—unappreciated.
>
> The first person who took my recommendation got through multiple seasons, on my repeated insistence, and still didn't like it.
>
> It wasn't until my senior year I met somebody who liked Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I met him because he commented on a friend's Facebook post about a totally different shared interest, and I messaged him, he wanted to hang out to my surprise, and then he invited me to his birthday party. There, I met other kids who went to his school, including the other Buffy fan I met in high school, one of his friends who walked right up to me with a big smile and was so enthusiastic about my Buffy love. 
>
> Two of the first friends I made in college, by extreme coincidence, loved nerdy shows, especially Joss Whedon shows and Buffy, and were the <!-- girls--> people in my neighboring dorm. One of them later told me she didn't like Buffy that much. Her girlfriend however was such a big Buffy fan that she even made me feel guilty for not knowing some trivia about one of the episodes. The other one was one of the only people I ever watched Buffy together with. They both became my best friends that semester and I half-lived in their dorm. The other dorm near ours also housed <!--a girl--> someone who liked Buffy a lot, by chance. I was roomed near them by the university's random selection. Extreme Buffy fandom wasn't *that* common in college.
>
> Buffy appreciation, quite honestly, was how I measured intelligence then. Wealth and higher education, though, also seemed to increase likelihood of Buffy fandom, but not so as to without further Buffy-factor predict intelligence. It was a big surprise to me to meet those people in the private school, and then more people in college, with an appreciation for the shows I appreciated. It was literally surreal.
>
> I was so nervous with the first group, and regret missing the chance to bond more with them. The second group didn't make sense to me, but I was surrounded, and there was no escape from the universe giving me a good social life.
>
> From college to PhD, I didn't know Henry's favorite show was Buffy.
> 
> I was accepted as his PhD student not knowing that. I found out two semesters into the PhD program, and was kind of shocked. He said he was "obsessed with" Buffy, which he added is "kind of weird." I dropped off my "Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Philosophy: Fear and Trembling in Sunnydale" book, with a kind note, in his mailbox as a gift, re-gifting it from my best friend.
>
> Henry had a rare taste for something that others hadn't heard of as much, that would later contribute to the creation of something everybody has heard of. Joss Whedon created Buffy, and later wrote The Avengers, exploding from esoteric-nerdom to Blockbuster-God-man to cancelled-bad-man. Interestingly, Henry quipped and talked in a way reminiscent to Joss Whedon, and had theater writing experience, though as my advisor, Henry was more like Giles, Buffy's Watcher (advisor). Similarly, the method that I had a rare appreciation for, MHDPA, that had gone on to transformer-roll-out into being ChatGPT, would, much like Marvel movies, destroy civilization.
>
> Back in high school, all the best shows got cancelled, for which Joss Whedon was notorious, because of Firefly. So, so as to distinguish both of us from bad movie execs and producers, I am adding this paragraph just to say that I am not cancelling Henry.


Henry, who at the time was the Director for the Institute of Data Science at the University of Rochester, got an offer to be the Director of AI at the National Science Foundation, which is an extremely, extremely, extra-prestigious role. So he accepted, initially advised me while directing at the NSF in Washington, DC, after about half a year started planning to give up being my advisor, reassured me that his knowledge of deep learning specifically wasn't good enough anyway, and instructed me to switch to Chenliang Xu as my next advisor, who gave me an ultimatum about joining.

<!--
Compared the threat of AI to thinking about "traffic regulation on Mars"

"Traffic regulation on mars" quote can frame how that’s what Henry’s NSF directorship job in DC was, while he neglected to see through his final student to the completion of his degree. 
-->

Henry thought Chenliang would be better due to his having more experience in deep learning, but may have overestimated how much any professor at our CS department could afford me in terms of anything related to research and methods. Chenliang, for example, who was working on state of the art Computer Vision, had about as much familiarity with MHDPA in 2020 as Dan Gildea had in 2018, perhaps a little more. Before I was his student, in 2020, I presented using MHDPA on image features as an encoder architecture for Semantic Segmentation to him, on his whiteboard, with an explanatory diagram in my journal for what MHDPA was that I showed him, and a diagram on the whiteboard for my proposed Semantic Segmentation method. Chenliang, as many Computer Vision professors didn't, didn't know much, if <!--at all-->anything, what MHDPA was until Vision Transformers gained popularity in 2021.

> [!NOTE]
> ### Giles
>
> Buffy the Vampire Slayer was my and Henry's favorite show.
> 
> In Season 6 of Buffy, Buffy's advisor Giles decided to leave. His reason was, ["<!--[I] w-->Wish I could stay, [...] Wish I could slay your demons, [...] But I'm standing in the way."](https://youtu.be/4YKg6016rTQ?si=o4e-46-oq1laf_23)

<!--
Chenliang was younger than Henry, a good amount closer to my age than Henry's, and didn't have tenure yet, though he acquired it [a couple years after accepting me into his lab. ]() -->

-->

<!-- He got tenure in that time, and had his son in that time. -->

Chenliang's real contribution was having GPUs, something I missed the deadline for while under Henry, as I had been given access to the NSF's for my honorable mention in the GRFP I applied to, but only if I made an account within a specified time window, right in the middle of my benzo withdrawal, that I missed.

-->

I worked under Chenliang for the next 3 years, 2020 - 2023.<!--, "only" managed to publish 2 papers in that time, and could've published far more if something about his group didn't constrict me. -->
<!-- I worked under Chenliang for the next 3 years, 2020 - 2023, managed to publish 2 papers in that time, and could've published far more if something about his group, which went strongly against Henry's hands-off and pressure-free approach, didn't constrict my more philosophical interests.
, at which point he wanted to reallocate funding to someone else with a faster publication rate, with short notice. -->

I managed to publish 2 papers under Chenliang. <!--The number of papers published by Henry's--> Henry's average student paper count was 1 - 3 across the PhD student's full 5 - 7 years. 
<!--
Chenliang had no other problems or qualms with me, the second professor to abandon his advising responsibility, this time with far less justification, seeing as Henry believed it would be best for me to have an advisor with deep learning experience, and had a stated intention, though unverified, to fund me himself if all else failed.
-->

Until Henry's retirement in 2022, which he didn't warn me about and came to me as a surprise from Chenliang, he stayed on as my PhD committee member.

To this day, Henry hasn’t acknowledged that what I was arguing to him about, had implemented, and had innovated on in 2018—MHDPA, the method that underpins transformers such as those used in <!--AI models like--> ChatGPT—was worth crediting me for to any of the other faculty, committee members, or future committee members, including those who exploited my work or ruled me negatively in the years to come. And while that wouldn't be an issue had he been oblivious to what followed, he isn't. The exploitation and rulings to come are all in his knowledge. Though he recently retired, it's not that hard to reply to an email chain and write, "Wow, our student was incredibly right!" or something <!--meaningfully crediting me-->to that effect, to at least give me some credit from the University of Rochester, given the huge foresight and work delivered to him by his own student before even 5 groups in the world had used the method, let alone every iPhone and AI research lab and AI foundation model, as has become the case now.

The bigger red light, is that Dean Wendi Heinzelman should've been filled in on all of what happened. I sent an [email](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Not-Enough-Carbs.md) about all of the medical malpractices that I asked to be shared, and [CC'd her](3-Disproof.md#email-10302023) on almost all of my emails after the subsequent events. She didn't respond. She ignored. Those emails are lying in her inbox. Dean Nick Vamivakas received [even more](3-Disproof.md#10302023---10312023-and-7-years-ago---now) emails than her, and did not address me either. Upwards of 13 independent medical malpractices, and starting from the next chapter, workers abuse injuries, all of which did not seem sufficiently believable to them in the state of agitated panic I sent them in, "flying colors" perhaps deemed deficient.

> [!NOTE]
> ### Incremental 2018
>
> The paper Henry discouraged me from submitting didn't change by a single word from the 2018 version by the time he believed it was ready to be submitted to NeurIPS in 2019.
> 
> I didn’t have the cognitive functioning to edit it beyond the submission from late 2018 that Henry rejected. 
>
> I submitted Henry's workshop paper earlier in 2019 and then my original paper to NeurIPS, by which point most people today think MHDPA was ubiquitous and well known in NLP, and the paper was rejected — for a laughable reason — it seemed none of the reviewers heard of MHDPA, at least one of the reviewers thought I was proposing MHDPA, *compared it to a different attention mechanism from before MHDPA*, and at least that one rejected on account of rejecting MHDPA, while the others rejected, I think, for not enough experiments.
> 
> In 2024, I deserve better, having done the work alone, in an environment where everybody discouraged me, 6 years ago, before more than even 4 groups in the world/history had used MHDPA, let alone every iPhone, foundation model, and AI research lab, and none in the world/history had innovated new methods on it. 2018-sort-of-incremental-improvement-to-MHDPA is much more valuable to a terminated PhD student than 2024 of that. And whether the improvement  is incremental is not obvious, since compared to other innovations that have garnered popularity since, it’s actually more intricate. To summarize it to Henry in early 2020, to boil it down, I described effectively Google’s Sparse Attention (2022) but in 2020, so even that was still original, since that’s somewhat less technically involved to boil down for Henry. If it sounds like I’m idea impoverished, I have more than enough executed ideas that are still revolutionary and novel today, and have implemented [UnifiedML](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder) primarily [since 2021](6-Opposing-Views.md), which — if were allowed to be finalized — includes a framework that can be used to train better models than ChatGPT, as well as real-time RL robotics, and more, so I can't without support, and the good method I implemented and submitted to Henry’s rejection in 2018 isn’t my priority, only a major evidence that the University of Rochester has taken a mountain of love and credit from me, for nothing — years of what could've been frontier progress taken by medical malpractice and doubt — that my new committee members thought I had to do more, effectively rejecting [UnifiedML](6-Opposing-Views.md#unifiedml), and [XRD project](6-Opposing-Views.md#niaz-abdolrahim), even as advisor Chenliang and PI Niaz (who oversaw the XRD project in the Mechanical Engineering department) wrote or said I was ready to defend. 
>
> In 2018, I built on top of a DeepMind Sonnet implementation of a transformer, there being no standardized infrastructures in 2018 for transformers, my MHDPA innovation in TensorFlow 1.x. TensorFlow was still declarative, and extremely inconvenient compared to how PyTorch and TensorFlow are imperative today. In 2018, I had to program Gumbel Softmax in TensorFlow 1.x myself, possibly the first ever to do so.
-->

<!--But it's not just a question of how much progress I made in 2018, but how much progress I would've made if not for the induced debilitation in the middle of it, that lasted more than a year, and which wasn't interupted until after Henry left, and I was already forced onto new work, to meet Chenliang's additional demands.-->

> ### MHDPA Summary
>
> 17 days after I was and the day before my birthday, Sam Altman was terminated as the head of OpenAI, the company credited for ChatGPT, the thing that used MHDPA, the method that I was the 5th "group" in the world to ever use, before every iPhone, foundation model, and AI research group in the world now does, and first in the world/history to ever innovate on, except as a single PhD student. And those other 4 "groups" were all DeepMind, whereas I was in an environment where everybody was oblivious to the value. My name is Sam Lerman. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, was terminated 17 days after I was, one day before my birthday, for working on an AGI research area that is pretty specifically close to my specialized research area (though shortly rehired after). The reason my paper wasn’t published as I found out from email record, is apparently Henry discouraged me from submitting my paper to the full conference in 2018, truncated my paper down to 3 pages, and got me to submit to a small workshop in April, 2019, at which point I was benzo brain damaged and extremely insecure about every perception and belief I had. I used his version exactly, even though mine’s really better, by far; it got rejected — not even for good reasons, but because the reviewers thought I was proposing MHDPA itself, not having heard of it previously, yes the method that underpins ChatGPT, and rejected MHDPA on account of it being, uh, too similar to different attention mechanisms from before MHDPA — yes, in other words, my paper was rejected because the reviewers thought I invented MHDPA — and after/concurrent with that I was literally brain damaged and then had to switch into Computer Vision under an extremely oppressive deadline from Chenliang, and by the time I could’ve done anything voluntarily, MHDPA ("transformers") were already commonplace, popularized, standardized, and actively revolutionizing the field<!--, haha-->. So, I had quite a flagpole that only email record now documents. I would laugh, but it's pretty tragic. Coincidentally — sorry, one more synchronicity — CMT, the company owned by the same company that owns the company Sam Altman is in charge of, OpenAI, Microsoft — deleted all record of conference submissions a week before my termination! They sent out a mass email. So, that workshop paper Henry got me to submit in April after having "discouraged" (his email documented words) me from submitting to the full conference in 2018 the previous year, had all traces deleted in October, 2023, a week before I was terminated, as reported to everybody by mass email. And the only record left that any of what I’m writing is true is in Henry and another professor’s email inbox, meaning — maybe — a lot of faith is needed in me to make anything about me systemically credible. The end. BUT, on top of that, I really appreciated Henry, so I win the emotional debate too — like disproportionately appreciated him as he discouraged me from the work I did, left as an advisor, and has since ignored all of my emails.
