## The Sampler

My sister came to our apartment and brought my mom and I to her dark-red mid-size crossover, that I thought looked like a car that symbolized the Devil. Compared to the cars my mom and I drove, it was much newer, much nicer, dark red. She was working as a nurse at the time and making a middle class income. My mom was working two jobs with a low income, and I was a doctoral student.

When we were driving, I remember we stopped at Clover St., due to a red light, and some instinct told me to jump out. The feeling was ominous. But together with that ominous feeling, as the drive progressed (before the stop and after), I sensed that a million worlds existed, and that all of them had evolved to converge to this one. So I sat somewhat reassured, in an uneasy anxiety, that what was happening will be okay. 

Except, the sense/vision/idea was wrong, this time. Instead of my fanciful ideas about quantum stochasticity in a single universe, I had this bizarre idea, specifically on this transit, about "Many worlds"—I know, how original. "Many worlds" is a standard interpretation in quantum physics, often an alternative to Copenhagen which also, like me, both usually and <!--I guess--> in my version here, tends to assume a single universe, the latter (Copenhagen and mine) do I mean.

In "Many worlds," or at least my version that I was conjuring up in my mind in the car, or I should say was pouring into my mind through a sheer awareness, everything that happened in the universe was evolved, through countless cycles of different trajectories, over cosmogenesis origins upon cosmogenesis origins, into the perfect exact happenings that were happening then. Now that's not really "Many worlds." That's one world, where it just cycles many times, like an AI training algorithm, and we just happen to be in the version that cycled in this way.

"Many worlds" is more nuanced. It says: there's a LOT of worlds—like at least 6. No, maybe a million. No, googolplex. Infinity! Undefined! And we're in this one, because "reasons."

Both of these theories/interpretations are wrong. But neglecting to explain why for now, I think either of these serve as an accessible way to quickly show that, even under a pretty standard physics interpretation, the possibility of "God" is not... I think the word I want to use is "not necessarily stupid."

I mentioned stochasticity in the universe's quantum mechanics. That means randomness. The universe, as it's theorized today, is fundamentally probabilistic. And physics does a great job of telling us that those probabilities are probabilities. No no, just look at Schrödinger's quantum wave function. See, it's a bunch of probability densities that splash around like a kiddie pool. And when those waves are especially high, that's where the particle is more likely to get sampled, or that's the more likely velocity of the particle, or that's the more likely "World" that gets sampled, or in my especially terrible vision, that's the "Cycle" that the universe just permanently converges to forever. 

So where can "God" fit into any of those interpretations, besides the last one being just "Godawful," no-pun-unintended (my puns are deterministic)? Well, ultimately, something has to select which world gets chosen. One way that could happen is through just the magic power of randomness. Another way, is that some *will* known as "statistical divergence" is able to allocate the probable from the improbable, and, within its holy bounds, tilt the scales a bit. The "Sampler"—who is the "Sampler"?

I sensed an ominous feeling as we were driving, and that same inner sense that gave me that kind-of vision about the many cycling-evolving worlds converging to this moment's exact perfection, told me to make a run for it when we stopped at Clover St., at a red light. 

My sister's car was big and red, like a giant Dirt Devil, and before we got into it, I immediately had the "Devil" association, appear like a fear in my mind, the first omen (ominous sense) of that drive. Well, the "Sampler" that was about to sample my fate could only have been a little red vacuum cleaner, because, this transit, not specifically just this transit but this transit as well, was taking me to Hell, and the Devil drive did not end on Clover St., nor on the hospital grounds. No, each ticking moment from the drive to the psychiatric unit, even back to home, was a cruise controlled, speed-limit-obeying, insidious, maybe even pleasant drive, deeper, into Hell, to a Hell of mind that only one door leaves.

But at this time, we were stopped on Clover St. A 4-leaf clover represents "luck," sampled luck.

As my sister must've thought, I'd be getting just standard quality care. What a lucky day. What a lucky world that was sampled. And then we proceeded, from Clover St., to the University of Rochester Strong Hospital for the first day of my benzo nightmare.

> Before my area exam, I was building a vision transformer for generalizing across Sonic the Hedgehog levels, but I didn’t realize it was a vision transformer (in the Computer Vision domain) since it was purely applied to reinforcement learning, and the crux of it for me was to use disentangled relational representations as queries to the episodic memory (k-nearest neighbors, made differentiable via weighted averaging attributed rewards), meant to give the episodic memory more generalizability since the relational representations extracted parts and their relations rather than the full entangled context, effectively treating the MHDPA heads like an ensemble of independent memory queries using my disentangling method from my earlier paper. This is still an extremely insightful symbolic understanding of how models can generalize across domains, where the relational representations are the generalizable components and the episodic memory was like the parameterized or recurrently-stored knowledge trained into models today via giant data corpora, except in both cases more explicitly programmed in as novel inductive biases. None of this was appreciated by my department, whatsoever. 
> - I was studying reinforcement learning (RL), from DQN, to policy gradients, to actor-critic, since the beginning of my PhD. It was at the forefront of my research, but completely unsupported and un-believed in until ChatGPT, which, besides MHDPA, was able to train human feedback into the model via an RL type algorithm, not exactly reinforcement learning since N-step future rewards aren't used—more like moving parameters in the direction of a gradient to maximize outputs that are assigned higher rewards by humans—analogous to policy gradient methods in RL—but enough to lend credibility to RL's utility for the first time in my PhD. The models that succeeded ChatGPT may have been less simplified, using actor-critic type behavior maximization rather than policy gradients, which are a little weaker. The full potential of RL, using N-step reward, over long time-scales, online learning, and multi-agent, is still unrealized. Exploration sampling is analogous to beam search type methods, and the latter could be applied, hypothetically, to environments in RL, as is actually the best technical analogy for "Many worlds."

> [!NOTE]
> I felt, ever since that sensation that my tongue was going back into my throat, some vestibular situation—something really changed, and has been different since. That oceanic feeling that John Lennon captured really well about his experiences with TM in the song ["Across the Universe"](https://youtu.be/90M60PzmxEE?si=2n0PJKmeekYA6etl) ([John Lennon wrote the song about TM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Across_the_Universe#Composition), both explicitly in his reference to "Jai guru deva om" and more ambiguously with his spot-on description of the state of consciousness induced by and, with respect to the mantra, during, TM) was gone. Since that "catatonia" (tongue-throat situation), my experiences/words during and following TM weren't "like endless rain into a paper cup." They had become coarse somehow, and instead of that vibrant "Kundalini" movement I felt before, there was a physical feeling in my neck, a right-angle tilt, even when I wasn't meditating. I first began noticing this while trying to meditate in the hospital at RGH.

Since RGH<!--After the Christmas, 2018 trauma-->, I wasn't able to access my meditation anymore.

The meditation still relaxed me. I still felt less social anxiety afterwards. It still gave my thoughts more peace. But physically, it felt neither like bliss nor like a body part that I directly controlled. I couldn't maneuver the breath, kundalini, blood circulation, whatever it was, through the different areas of my physical psyche (and actual body), and my given mantra, that I repeated silently in my mind as part of the meditation, didn't carry itself to the same places of acuity that it naturally did before, where rather than the hard sensation of speaking my inner voice that now characterizes my mantra's audition, the mantra had before "tapped," "dissolved," become so soft until it literally couldn't be heard except in awareness and all of my thoughts were then fully adherent to both my will and my natural rhythm, and no energy was lost no matter how verbosely or viscerally I thought then, and each one came like ["endless rain into a paper cup,"](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Across_the_Universe%23:~:text%3DThe%2520flavour%2520of%2520the%2520song,the%2520link%2520to%2520the%2520chorus.&ved=2ahUKEwjGvszQ1rOIAxXlhIkEHdwgLcwQFnoECBsQAw&usg=AOvVaw1MtnfbSbXSsMu_w1lg6V_v) where just the [right word](Philosophy/My-Spirituality.md), or visual or association, corresponded to both my will and my rhythm, beautifully, sometimes blissfully, sometimes catastrophically<!--, maybe even orgasmically-->.

The physical sensations before the hospitalization were ones I could control, as in, they came naturally, were a part of me, and didn’t involve concentration or discomfort or movement through any kind of forcing. They felt like a tongue in my body that I controlled and owned and my consciousness controlled those movements, the physical sensations, and everything else in my mind and behavior. Today, that level of unity doesn’t exist in me, even with the same amount of discipline or far more disciplines<!-- and knowledge-->.

The limit was physics and the physiology and neurology mechanics therein. The analogy I came up with, is that we are like individual neurons in a brain, similar to the analogy made about "waves in an ocean," but which conveys intelligence in those constituent waves, that despite their independence somehow compose the larger intelligence of the universe, like neurons, not necessarily knowing the larger singularity they compose. My physiology, whatever changed, wasn't transcendable.

In my second hospitalization, the environment was much better than RGH's. I made friends with Sarah, Hudson, and other inpatients. We [played](https://youtu.be/cco_DvSzrts?si=pmfrQ4XEaLF1teEK&t=51) Guitar Hero together, there was a piano, there were TVs, one of the public rooms had big windows, we even were taken across floors of the hospital for music jamming sessions with lots of instruments, they had their yoga and meditation instructions as well, and of all of my hospitalizations to come, this was perhaps the best care unit I was gated by armored vault into. 

Sarah's sister's name is "Kundalini Grace." I hadn't heard of "Kundalini" until after I had those visceral, physical sensations in the House on May St. Then I looked up those sensations I was experiencing and found, for the first time, not having heard the word or of those movements and sensations before, the term "Kundalini," made more credible to me by the philosophy's appreciation by the depth psychologist Carl Jung, who I was reading at the time, and whose views, very distinct from Freud's, on the existence of a subconscious, and its mystical-transcendent connection, helped explain some of what I was witnessing.  

Sarah Young's last name is "Jung," she hadn't heard of Carl Jung, she and I kept observing synchronicities while we were there, and she kept a synchronicity list. To me, no synchronicities happened yet that were bigger than just the uncanny precision and specificity of the I Ching's answers. However, I was still seeing some unambiguous synchronicities, as well as not seeing many others, including that the word "synchronicity" was actually coined by Jung, and now I was remarking on them  together with one Sarah "Jung." But there were more I hadn't seen, and more, much bigger, that would come.

The House on May St., in retrospect was one big synchronicity. I got the Facebook student housing page moderatorship just before I had to move out, and was able to deliver on my promise to fill my landlord's house (and houses) with grad students. Not to mention, the house itself. Having that whole house, pretty much to myself, a beautiful antique house, for relatively pennies, the same house I had my AI and physics revelations—"luck" seems to forget a lot of context.

So the word "synchronicity" was already familiar, as was Jung, as was Kundalini, as was Grace, by the time Sarah and I met in the hospital. 

Sarah was early 20s, by chance hospitalized at the same time as me, also early 20s. She was a year older. 

We played Guitar Hero, I continued all of my meditation and yoga regimen, and my family, including my mom, uncle and aunt, and cousin brought in Paleo diet food for me, which I ate for my eczema but which also helped with my cognition, instead of the unhealthy processed type food of the hospital. And I shared crapes with Sarah<!--(another inpatient)-->, that my aunt brought in each time she and my uncle visited. They weren't 100% Paleo (buckwheat, goat cheese), but still delicious.

So to summarize, I was doing daily meditation, twice a day, daily yoga each morning, and eating a Paleo diet in the hospital, as well as now socializing well. On top of all of that, and antipsychotics, surely the missing ingredient to cure me would be an involuntary >6 months course of benzos.

My brother-in-law came in with my sister and I explained to him relational reasoning and the paper I finished, the method of MHDPA. I explained to him the method underlying ChatGPT from my hospital ward 4 years before ChatGPT. And at the time, he thought my explanation was cool, but it'd've been hard to predict would be such a big thing, one that others in my field and the world would have heard of or have anywhere to as much belief in the utility in AI of, in the near-term or in the years to come. It was hard to predict for my professors and faculty, too. At the time, 2018/early-2019, most at the University of Rochester still thought deep learning was a fad. None of the professors or other PhD students were doing research on MHDPA, let alone had heard of MHDPA. [They might claim otherwise](../4-Holy-Faith/1-Right-to-Talk-About-Suicide-Seriously.md#academia--medicine). Besides the paper that proposed MHDPA itself, my innovation to MHDPA, was the first innovation to MHDPA ever, in the world/history. A small handful of others applied it, from research groups in DeepMind, none literally innovated *on* the method.

I showed my MHDPA innovation paper to Sarah. She was amazed that she could read it since usually, she said, that kind of stuff isn't readable, and brought up one more synchronicity. Her mom was a writer who had a published short story in a Stephen King anthology, a writer of horror. I was indeed in a hospitalization that was like a pretty good short story in an otherwise Stephen King anthology/horror. 

Not that my lucidity needed further evidence, but I explained the methods of late-2022 ChatGPT to inpatient and visitors, in early-February, Winter, 2019, while drugs were altering and innovating on the functioning of my biological neural networks.

### Hudson

Our other companion was Hudson, who caught me as I was being discharged and handed me this letter in an envelope, that I opened later from my apartment:

<p align="center">
<img width="300" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-12 at 8 10 34 PM" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alder-tree/Assets/refs/heads/main/BrokenWisdoms/Hudson-Letter.jpeg">
</p>

It's great<!--I'm impressed--> he was able to write at all. He had depression, was in the hospital for depression, was being treated for depression, was medicated for depression, and was electroshocked weekly, for depression. He went through electroshock therapy during my stay there.

Meanwhile, I was being brain damaged by benzos, but who could've known that? (I did, because I made the case articulately, sufficiently so, to all of my psychiatrists. As I predicted, longer-term benzo use is dangerous, causes extreme physical dependence, and can result in unthinkable suffering). 

I was told a court order would be acquired if I didn't take them, even as I was taking antipsychotics.

### Third Hospitalization, and Drugging Kids

> My instincts still haven't ceased, and I still interpret them as Tao, except with more experience, and the "threats" have evolved into helpful or sabotaging suggestions, what others with frontal lobes might just observe in themselves, less acutely perhaps than somebody mid-psychotic-trance, as "social energies, social sense, social skill, maybe emotional intelligence, or emotion," and frontal lobes should, as a general rule of thumb, be handled delicately when just growing in, by the way, as they tend to in a person's early 20s, when by totally-random-amazing-coincidence, schizophrenic episodes are most likely to occur in a person whose relationships with those energies of their intelligence might not be as integrated as with other impressive energies of their intelligence, and that integration can be initially exactly as intense as it's supposed to be minus the external orders that make it quite paranoid and scary — did I just explain schizophrenia in one sentence? Anyway, that truth about not intervening while parts are still growing in, is quintuply true about people under 20.
>
> I met Mobi in my next hospitalization. A couple years later, I learned that Sarah had met Mobi in one of <!--their-->her hospitalizations, too, that he'd even braided Sarah's hair. Mobi was a recurrent inpatient care unit psychiatric recipient. He was 16, clearly intelligent, had a "sober" intelligence and humor, was respectful, kind, and chill. They'd been giving him benzos for 2 years at that point, on and perhaps-sporadically-off, from the age of about 14, and he was in there mainly, or only, for drug problems and addiction. Acclimating to benzos, one's brain becomes deprived of GABA and will crave something, usually drugs, to take the literal neural edge off, to silence those disproportionate Glutamates and other action potentials whose balancing complement, GABA, is downregulated, throughout the brain. Benzos are a hard drug, and are as addictive as any hard drug. He was a 16-year-old drug addict, and they kept institutionalizing him for his drug issues and prescribing daily benzos.
>
> Maybe he was such a big alcoholic at the age of 14 that the benzos were the inescapable treatment that the psychiatrists had to resort to, but I doubt it. When it gets to the point that kids are being inoculated with benzos, psychiatrists should ask themselves whether they have a problem, some kind of addiction maybe<!--, to prescribing benzos, and seek help-->. There is a path to recovery, a 12-step program, starting with (1) stop. (2) Ask yourself, "Will society really be ruined if this kid is helped in some more-substantive way?" The next 10 steps involve reforming society, so I leave that as an exercise to the reader.
>
> These traumas are inflicted on kids, in hospitals and schools alike. Schools, today, are where kids give the best hours of their day. It's where, today, kids obey authority and follow merciless programs, with such stress that the authority and obedience structures disseminate to kids, and create a psychology of competition, mercilessness, and almost-necessitated-by-example-and-infliction bullying. Rather than being like summer camps, schools today are literal concentration camps, where concnetration is required, at a white board or black board or projection screen until learning "happens." Hospitals and schools should take inspiration from summer camps (no coercion, social, integrated with nature), monasteries (intuitive aesthetic for peace), and the fact that YouTubers make better educational content through their channels than what most schools offer, except often way faster-to-learn-from and more truthfully/deep/intelligently/respectfully-to-audience/entertainingly when it comes to the learning curriculum, from the intuitions to the in-the-weeds material specifics, that can be curated into many diversely branching tracks, while tools like [Quora](https://www.quora.com) and [Piazza](https://piazza.com/) make learning by oneself, in one's own designed, uncoerced fashion, more easy than ever, while the incentive becomes more than sufficiently high for not needing punishment, threat, and concentration obedience structures.

### Corporal Abuse

>
> I ordered a margarita in a 2016 birthright Israel trip (a program that I really like, since it makes affordable vacations), with Jeremiah probably somewhere at the table, thinking I was ordering a drink, and they brought me just this big margherita pizza. That's a fun story. Combined with benzos, that is, if I took my prescription for social anxiety that day, I suppose the effect would've been worse, neurologically and physically, than if they brought me a margarita. I mean: benzos are worse than tequila, [at least 100% blue agave respasado tequila](2-Medical-Malpractices.md#jordan-peterson), in my opinion.[^1]

> That was also the trip where I was complaining [my hair was too long](https://www.facebook.com/share/qQqsQLv4Cgvbv7UZ/) (as many people heard/"witnessed") the whole trip, perhaps **(1)** another almost-preternatural-seeming omen (this time in 2016 rather than 2017, when I started the Dupilumab), besides the **(2)** [electric razor breaking](1-Medical-Malpractices.md#foreboding-electric-razor), that preceded the **(3)** [very vivid nightmare that I had](1-Medical-Malpractices.md#premonition-or-omen) the night of my first injection of Dupilumab (waking up every 5 minutes all night, each time being "assaulted" or the impending of it, for the whole night, every 5 minutes) and **(4)** [me growing out my facial hair (beard and mustache) for the first time](1-Medical-Malpractices.md#house-on-may-st), by chance, just before Aetna's cut-off of me from the drug.

> And we all got extremely sick, suddenly, everyone on our bus, 10 plus people, 10 - 30 people, originating from a guy on the trip who wasn't me or Jeremiah. My cousin Irina, who went with me, and I, got the most sick, of the whole bus, really severe fever, sneezing, sinuses, coughing, vomiting, more. I recall she was even prescribed an opioid, besides Sudafed.
>
> About two years after my first Strong Hospital hospitalization, Jeremiah, who I hadn't seen since the trip to Israel, commented on a Facebook post that I'd made about the trauma that benzos induced on me, about some of his experiences. He wrote publicly on my post about how some psychiatric medication he had to take caused him to have a seizure. "[...] I've had bad side effects from medications that caused me to have a seizure one time that was no fun. [...]" Benzos, one of the drugs he was prescribed and the only plausible culprit of the ones he told me, [cause seizures during the brain's GABA downregulation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21815323/#:~:text=Withdrawal%20seizures%20have%20occurred%20with,time%20and%20at%20high%20doses.), a widely suffered and standardly known side effect of longer-term benzo use. <!--Those were almost definitely the medication--> <!-- of his--> <!--he was referring to.-->
>
> He also wrote how he was held down and choked, on pavement outside, after being tackled, on the hard rough pavement, by the university-hospital police officers, when he tried to make a run for it. "I tried to escape and they held me down and choked me. I got to the driveway [...]" Analogously, my next hospitalization also involved combative resistance to hospitalization, following the >year of benzo-induced torture. In October, 2020, I was also physically coerced by the police, due to having a "breakdown," I suppose it can be called—quiet, peaceful, and spiritually-directed—in the grass of my apartment complex, where I'm pretty sure I was legally allowed to, or within parameters. Efforts to escape medical custody might have other causes besides bravery and spirituality (if one is willing to extend the benefit of the doubt that I'm not stupid), for example (1) induced by disinhibitions from prescribed pharmaceutical drugs, or (2) the quality of the care provided within medical custody, or other snowballing longer-term medical-institution causes, such as (3) resistance due to earlier trauma from a previous medical intervention, like the benzo coercion that traumatized me. So, in consequence, the medical application of police brutality can result as one of the negative side effects of a pharmaceutical drug, wherein the medical system is committing physical violence in order to reinforce the drug, care, or practice that led to their own physical violence or the patient's combative resistance. They also are very coercive inside the hospital, especially in the early transit before the psychiatric unit, e.g., making you sit in one place, wear what they want you to wear, take the drugs they give you or otherwise be injected with them, etc.

## From RL to "Many Worlds"

> To do:

- ChatGPT claims to use RL
- LLM's "exploration strategy" via beam search type methods can inspire RL
- Applied to RL environments, this equates to the "Many Worlds" concept, except now intelligent, and if differentiable, optimizable towards a purpose
 - And taking inspiration from MHDPA, can be applied to multi-headed particles, as my own theory does
- I studied RL throughout my PhD
 - I did RL my whole PhD
 - Implemented everything
- Was suddenly made credible for the first time thanks to ChatGPT, as my MHDPA research had been made in the earlier years thanks to the explosion of transformers, which also, next to RL for human feedback, underpins ChatGPT
 - And even more recently, has been made more credible with real-time RL robotics (which [I was one of the first to do](#real-time-rl-robotics)), and apparently even OpenAI's "Q*" project, for which the CEO, Sam Altman, was, not long after I was (17 days), terminated

- I did RL my whole PhD

#### From RL to "Many Worlds," and Other Research

Before my area exam, I was building a vision transformer for generalizing across Sonic the Hedgehog levels, but I didn’t realize it was a vision transformer (in the Computer Vision domain) since it was purely applied to reinforcement learning, and the crux of it for me was to use disentangled relational representations as queries to the episodic memory (k-nearest neighbors, made differentiable via weighted averaging attributed rewards), meant to give the episodic memory more generalizability since the relational representations extracted parts and their relations rather than the full entangled context, effectively treating the MHDPA heads like an ensemble of independent memory queries using my disentangling method from my earlier paper. This is still an extremely insightful symbolic understanding of how models can generalize across domains, where the relational representations are the generalizable components and the episodic memory was like the parameterized or recurrently-stored knowledge trained into models today via giant data corpora, except in both cases more explicitly programmed in as novel inductive biases. None of this was appreciated by my department, whatsoever. 
- I was studying reinforcement learning (RL), from DQN, to policy gradients, to actor-critic, since the beginning of my PhD. It was at the forefront of my research, but completely unsupported and un-believed in until ChatGPT, which, besides MHDPA, was able to train human feedback into the model via an RL type algorithm, not exactly reinforcement learning since N-step future rewards aren't used—more like moving parameters in the direction of a gradient to maximize outputs that are assigned higher rewards by humans—analogous to policy gradient methods in RL—but enough to lend credibility to RL's utility for the first time in my PhD. The models that succeeded ChatGPT may have been less simplified, using actor-critic type behavior maximization rather than policy gradients, which are a little weaker. The full potential of RL, using N-step reward, over long time-scales, online learning, and multi-agent, is still unrealized. Exploration sampling is analogous to beam search type methods, and the latter could be applied, hypothetically, to environments in RL, as is actually the best technical analogy for "Many worlds."

Also before my area exam, I taught Henry "sequence-to-sequence attention" from my office, in a state of misery that I couldn't convey, as I was also working on further innovations to MHDPA, now suffering due to grad-level classes, TAship, impending area exam, and the brain damage. I tried to tell Henry what was going on and he couldn't understand the severity, giving me an anecdote about his son's medication.

[^1]: I mean: benzos, especially combined with pizza (margherita), is worse than tequila (margarita), [at least how I drink tequila (100% blue agave respasado tequila](2-Medical-Malpractices.md#jordan-peterson) diluted in a not-from-concentrate 100% organic juice tonic), in my opinion (and note, the two should not be mixed), with or without the pizza<!--, and probably for most medical uses, to the body and brain—again, my reasonable opinion [with more evidence in support of than against](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms-V3-in-progress/blob/main/2-Opposing-Views/2-Medical-Malpractices.md#psychiatry-at-the-university-of-rochesters-strong-hospital), both sparse if anecdote is excluded but even then, and some open-minded common sense-->. If a hard liquor cocktail being better than a standard medicine is too ridiculous to contemplate, then consider other [plausibly better, equally effective, healthier GABA agonists](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2823376/#:~:text=Muscimol%2C%20a%20constituent%20and%20psychoactive,Brunton%20et%20al%2C%202006) (Muscimol) that the industry has [avoided comparative study on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscimol#Clinical_research) (as of 2024, "handful of exploratory clinical trials<!--"-->," <!--for [some of the most wrong possible uses](https://thischangedmypractice.com/long-term-benzodiazepine-mortality-schizophrenia/), "in the treatment of schizophrenia, ..." that could lead to [mortality](https://thischangedmypractice.com/long-term-benzodiazepine-mortality-schizophrenia/) in analogously acting drugs, neurodegenerative disorders [as if the psychiatric system didn't induce them through analogously acting drugs enough](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms-V3-in-progress/blob/main/2-Opposing-Views/3-PhD-Faculty-Malpractices.md#charles-venuto), and [no anxiety clinical trials](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=muscimol+anxiety&filter=dates.1000%2F1%2F1-2024%2F12%2F31), *i.e.*, they are unable to reason and prioritize based on analogy/similarity to known mechanisms of action, as if a physicist were not able to predict the magnetic behavior of metals based on other metals with similar properties, and these are not bad research areas in the infinitum of research, but these are bad prioritization of research, what data is most lacking, promising, and has the most learning-and-plausible-medicinal value to be collected first, and that's perhaps sufficiently emphasized by-->and [no anxiety clinical trials](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=muscimol+anxiety&filter=dates.1000%2F1%2F1-2024%2F12%2F31), for a plant medicine/extract that has been **(1)** used for thousands of years, **(2)** grows naturally, **(3)** is known to have a similar mechanism of action to benzos by pharmacologists, and **(4)** is experienced as having also extremely similar effects but without many reported downsides). The reverence given to the field is disproportional to their actual intelligence. That's evidenced nowhere more than the dosage, rate, and longevity at which benzos are prescribed, analogous to telling a patient to take 4 or more shots of tequila per day, for a year, so as to never be sober through the whole duration of their prescription. This is a different kind of serial corporal abuse. The body can take most anything once, short of overdoses. If the body gets punched<!-- and a bone doesn't break-->, it will heal. But if the body keeps getting punched over and over again, without stop, it breaks. <!--Rotten tequila + serial corporal abuse = medicine?--> I wish I could say the clinical data was extensive and methodologically sound enough for scientists to have faith in the experts respective to those fields, but their data contradicts them and isn't comprehensive enough for their conclusions. Reasoning principles pertaining to nature is not all that's missing. Reasoning generally, such as learning from proximal analogy and prioritizing accordingly. For example, the few sparse studies of Muscimol didn't target anxiety, as [most plausibly benefits from GABA agonists](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15078116/), but did prioritize areas where [mortality is plausible](https://thischangedmypractice.com/long-term-benzodiazepine-mortality-schizophrenia/) and [the ailment is caused](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms-V3-in-progress/blob/main/2-Opposing-Views/3-PhD-Faculty-Malpractices.md#charles-venuto) from the analogous knowns (benzos), in the treatment of schizophrenia and neurodegenerative disorders respectively. [Knowledge of intelligence](2-Medical-Malpractices.md#benzodiazepine-benzos-mechanism-of-action), evolutionary principles and reasoning by proximal analogy to both knowns and anecdotes, is necessary for the development of integrity in the field of psychiatry. Pharmacologists meanwhile are trying to develop chemicals that can be consumed every day and add to a person's health. That's called food. Drugs aren't food. Supplements and substitutes for food or body (e.g., thyroid hormone if a person has had a thyroid surgically removed) make sense. Those are ingredients of the food and body. If psychiatric medicines taken everyday are "food," nutritious additions to a person's body that add to their physical and mental health, by their claimed definition, something about that warrants some suspicion. When it comes to daily consumption, the answer is usually less or different, not more, decrease or different, [not increase](2-Medical-Malpractices.md#psychiatry-at-the-university-of-rochesters-strong-hospital), except in the case of nature, exercise, relationships, social satisfaction, socioeconomic security, and activities that induce "less" when done more, like meditation and yoga.
