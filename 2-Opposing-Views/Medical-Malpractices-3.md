## My Grandma's Hair, Nails, and Dementia

### Childhood

### $\Huge &#8220;$
*Moscow was bombed every day, sometimes multiple times a day. 500 airplanes bombed the city in one day. Not only bombs, but also a lot of lighters were thrown from the airplanes. The alarm of the air raid required everyone to step down to the underground [bomb shelters], and I went there too. But if the air raid came at the time of our work shift, we, all working at the armory [defense factory], children*<!-- [children working at the defense factory]-->*, climbed on the roof. Our responsibility was to take the hot lighters and throw them off the roof, to prevent a fire.*
### $\Huge &#8221;$
&ensp;&ensp; - Translated to English by my mom from an interview with my grandma that my mom did for MCC, in October, 2000. Brackets denote my edits.

My grandma was 13 and my great aunt Tsilia was 18. Their dad was fighting in the war front. Their mother had died when my grandma was 5 and her sister was 10, from typhus. Their step mother was sick with tuberculosis; and their little younger step-brother Yura, 10 years younger than my grandma, was too young to help with throwing the fire bombs.

<!--
My grandma was about 24 when she and my grandpa (different Yura) arrived to Samarkand.  She was a German language teacher, before my uncle was born. She didn't know German, but she knew Yiddish, so she accepted the job, since Yiddish is close to German. Later, she was a teacher of Russian language and Russian literature, separate fields. Later, she was an academic principal of a school and continued teaching.

### Nails

My grandma was about 24 when she and my grandpa (different Yura) had to immigrate to Samarkand.  She was a German language teacher, before my uncle was born. She didn't know German, but she knew Yiddish, so she accepted the job, since Yiddish is close to German. Later, she was a teacher of two separate fields, Russian language, and literature, and later, an academic principal of a school and continued teaching.

At old age, she had long grey hair, down to even her waist or hips. She curled it up behind her head, in a very elegant/pretty bun, with hair pins.

I inherited my mom's hair, who inherited my grandma's hair.

<!--My grandma had long grey hair, down to almost her waist or hips. She curled it up behind her head with hair pins, like in a bun but prettier.-->

In addition to losing all of my hair — head, eyebrows, and eyelashes — due to the Dupilumab cessation, my eczema temporarily spiked and I lost my fingernails in functionality in later 2018, also unambiguously due to the Dupilumab cessation. They regrew, healthily functional enough, after being purple, and bendy like putty, for a really long time, maybe into 2019. 

`Additional side effects included temporarily worsened eczema, and fingernails turning purple and bending like putty.`

My grandma actually told me I had her nails. I even remember where. But I also have her eyes, and my mom's eyes, brown eyes. But, randomly, my grandma mentioned it, about my nails, when we were sitting in the backseat of the car. My mom and grandpa were in the front seats. My mom was probably driving us to the Jewish Community Center, to swim in the community pool there. My grandma saw my fingers and just mentioned that I had her nails, unusual.

Without hair, without eyebrows and eyelashes, with even my grandma's fingernails purple and bending out of my nails, and isolation and heavy workloads, just what I needed was a >6 months course of benzos to get all the symptoms of early-onset dementia.

### The Probable Cause of My Grandma's Dementia

Benzos [contribute to the likelihood of dementia in elderly people](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6325366/).

My grandma was prescribed a cocktail of neuroactive drugs before she had dementia. Seroquel, Lyrica, Xanax, and the brochure goes on. She didn't have any of the conditions those medications are primarily supposed to treat (Seroquel is an antipsychotic, Lyrica is an antiepileptic, Xanax is a benzo), and every time she developed a new symptom from one, they prescribed yet another. She developed dementia when I was still in high school. She lived with dementia from then to my Junior year of college, the same year my grandpa died, 2016.

<!--
That semester I was dating somebody who told me something about my nails. My grandma actually told me I had her nails. I even remember where. But I also have her eyes, and my mom's eyes, brown eyes. But, randomly, my grandma mentioned it, about my nails, when we were sitting in the backseat of the car. My mom and grandpa were in the front seats. My mom was probably driving us to the Jewish Community Center, to swim in the pool there. My grandma saw my fingers and just mentioned that I had her nails, unusual, but something I'm proud of.

In 2016, the semester she died, someone I was dating made an even more unusual remark about my nails.

## How My Grandpa Died

### Lyubimey V'nuk

When I was a kid, I listed off my favorite family members once, in my order of favorite, in front of all of them who were in our apartment living room, either standing or eating at the table. Maybe I was 5 or so. I remember they all looked big and I was standing. Grandpa was sitting in his bigger chair at the table and I started, "Babula" ("Grandma"), "Máma," "Marina," ... and then after all the others who I listed, I listed my grandpa. I still remember that. He wasn't offended, and I love and loved my grandpa a lot. In maybe 16 years, I would be standing by his bedside in the hospital, after a heart surgery he had, when he'd tell me: "Ti moy lyubimey v'nuk" ("You are my favorite grandson."). He has 4 grandkids: Irina, Lena, Marina, and me. I'm his only grandson... 

I remember sitting by my grandpa's bedside, alternating days and nights. My mom or I were needed there at all times. He was almost 88, and the languages he spoke were Russian, Ukrainian, and Yiddish, and he was legally blind. He and I couldn't watch the same TV when he lived with us, because he neither spoke English nor could see, but sometimes when I visited my grandma's and his apartment unit immediately across from ours (after they'd moved, since originally we lived together), we watched Russian Television Network together, and they actually got some Cable channels from the government program, as well. In my apartment, we only had ABC, FOX, NBC, CBS, and PBS. Then we also got an additional channel, the CW. With high school and college, I had, uh, resourcefulness, and Netflix. During those days and nights at his bedside in the hospital, in the hospital recliner chair next to him, I watched a lot of Doctor Who on Netflix on my laptop, a show about an alien with two hearts called The Doctor that resurrects after each death, the previous generation surviving in the next, and the next, and the next. It's the [longest running science fiction show in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who#:~:text=The%20series%20has%20been%20listed,ratings%2C%20DVD%20and%20book%20sales.), a show that originally started with an old grandpa.

### Surgery

My grandpa survived two heart attacks previously, one in Uzbekistan and one in America. 

Here is how he ended up in the hospital: Sometime in the month of November, in 2015, he was having trouble breathing, my mom took him to his primary care doctor, she diagnosed him with congestive heart failure, she prescribed pills, then about a month and a week of taking pills later, he was still having trouble breathing, my mom took him to the hospital, they took a blood analysis, and apparently he'd had a third heart attack, that occurred about a week before. So my grandpa's heart doctor came into the hospital, recommended a stent be put in my grandpa's heart's main artery, via a surgery, and that the surgery would use an angiogram. The angiogram would require a dye that is bad for the kidneys. The primary care physician wanted to discharge my grandpa and send him for rehabilitation already, without the surgery; the heart doctor told my mom "without the surgery, his heart would only get worse" and that "he'd only have heart attacks and eventually die," so my mom chose to listen to the heart doctor, they did the angiogram, they tried to do the surgery, but the main artery was completely blocked, the surgeon wasn't able to do the surgery so put stents into the little arteries that were narrow but weren't the cause of the congestive heart failure, and right after the impromptu-alternative-surgery, which required an angiogram, which used the dye that was bad for the kidneys, my grandpa's kidneys got so bad he couldn't walk at all anymore; he couldn't stand up on his feet.

I was visiting him on alternating nights before and after the surgery. Then, after the New Year 2016, the hospital didn't know what do with him, discharged him, and sent him to the Jewish home for rehabilitation, for physical therapy to help with his worsened kidneys. They also scheduled a follow-up appointment with his heart doctor in that heart doctor's private office, separate from both the hospital and Jewish home, in a different location from either, for January 21, 2016.

### Transit

My grandpa was a self-reliant man, but the transit two weeks later on January 21, 2016 from the Jewish home to that heart doctor's office was extreme. My mom was there, and it was a big ordeal just to help him stand amid the kidney problems that were causing him difficulty moving. How big a toll that transfer of locations took: they resorted to using an elevating machine that lifted him, an almost 88 year old man, up from his bed. 

"Why was he discharged from the hospital?" the heart doctor had asked at that appointment in his office. "In this condition, he should be in the hospital."

My grandpa's heart failed that night, after the grueling trial to make the heart doctor appointment, in all likelihood because of that grueling trial. His official death was the night of that heart doctor appointment, January 22, 2016.

My grandpa was not one to miss a grueling transit. On July 3, 1941, my grandpa, his mom Maná, and his younger sister Rosá evacuated Ukraine. They went place to place by train, lived in different places, worked at farms. Once, they took the train from Rostov, and the train stopped. My grandpa was young, maybe 14. He thought, "I'll go to the market nearby and buy something." He bought a little bit of bread and kielbasa. When he came back, he discovered his train already left. So he asked people. They said, "There's a place where those trains stop. You can go there and take another train; they go the same direction, so maybe you can catch up with your previous train," and he saw, one train had already started moving, one train there on that platform, already in motion, and he decided he could jump, so he jumped. He was holding on, but he was gonna fall, and he thought he was gonna fall under the train. But there was someone who picked him up, quickly pulled him on (elevated him onto this big mechanical machine), someone on that train, someone who was there who quickly pulled him up. He ended up making it to their previous train's destination before his mom and sister, waiting for them, as theirs which had more stops in their transit's journey, arrived after him.

This time, my grandpa arrived a little before my grandma, despite being a little younger, in the same year, just a few months before.

In Uzbekistan, it was custom for doctors to visit patients. Physicians always came to patient homes, or wherever the patient was, standardly, in Uzbek healthcare. But America and Uzbekistan had something in common, regarding their healthcare systems: cardiologists (heart doctors) specifically, didn't visit patient homes. In our neighboring apartment units, my grandpa was having trouble breathing, but could still walk, and had survived three heart attacks previous to his death. Perhaps the heart doctor was right, and he'd keep having heart attacks and eventually die, but eventually was the night of their appointment, after a heroic ordeal to get to that office that my grandpa, with heavy strain, survived, and made it back in time to the Jewish home for his final destination, earlier than had he never gotten off the first train for some bread and kielbasa.

## When My Grandma Died

### Food

My grandma, Asya Lerman (Hebrew/American: "Esya") always cooked, healthy and really well, but she had type-2 diabetes at old age.
I remember, for herself, she had to use artificial sweeteners because she couldn't eat pure sugar.
She also made these delicious Russian cookies for us called "Korshike," that I loved, that she also put into these different mold shapes, hearts and stars and fish and circles. I liked to eat the raw dough sometimes, but she didn't let me eat it in large quantities because of eggs and the risk of salmonella.

I had healthier food than the average American as a kid — plov, cabbage stews, potato stews, salads, katleti, tefteli, borscht, pelmeni — despite my family's poverty, but I still had eczema, allergies, and asthma through my whole childhood.

My grandma taught my mom dancing when they were younger, in Uzbekistan. Seeing my grandpa bedridden in the hospital, even before the surgery, it was obvious to me that he was losing strength, just from the sedentary confinement to bed, that the doctors put him in, in a corner of a concrete-surrounded hospital, with no natural light, nature, or fresh air. He would've benefited from some motion, out of bed and walking, outdoors, with nature, with fresh air. At least once a day, each day, without any grueling transits to reach such an environment.

I really think had the hospital recommended my grandpa an organic steak/salmon-only diet, and nothing more, they possibly could've saved his main artery from being blocked, without a surgery. Then no stents would be put into his healthier narrow arteries, no damaged kidneys, no grueling transit to heart doctor. Just physical therapy and rehabilitation. And maybe many more years, living beyond my grandma.

### Numerical Timings

She shortly outlived my grandpa, and died the same year as him **three days before** his April 16 birthday, on April 13, 2016.

I suppose she'd've had to forestall her death as well, then, seeing she died just a few months after he died, in the same year, as if on purpose, joining him exactly 3 days before his April 16 birthday, on April 13, 2016, where 13 both symbolizes a death kind of day and has the number 3, as in 3 days before, and 2016 has the number 16, the upcoming day of my grandpa's birthday.

She couldn't have died on a more perfect day, except if my grandpa lived a many, many years longer.

My grandpa also gets two claims to rhythmic numerical timing: (1) He entered the hospital on December 22, 2015, spent two weeks in the hospital, two weeks in the Jewish home, and then died exactly a month after, on January 22, 2016, (2) He, Yury Lerman, was born "Izya"; but during the war, as documents were lost and "Izya" was a Jewish name amid an extremely anti-semitic Ukraine, he called himself "Yura," or the full name, "Yury," and that became his new name with the new documents when he was about 16, the same age (16 again) as my name was officially changed to "Sam" actually, by amazing ancestral-but-unintended rhyme.

Now for some stretchier synchronicities:

As for my grandma, the number 13 also includes a number that "is less than 3," e.g. a heart <3, which a modern readership might be able to visually appreciate universally across languages, having been a teacher of varied languages, including Ukrainian, Russian, Yiddish, and German (and she also learned English after we immigrated), in her life.

Besides 16, another synchronistic number is 7. My grandma was born March 25, 1927. My mom was born July 17, 1957 (07/17/57). And <!--my cousin--> Irina, who takes the most from my grandma besides me, was born November 17, one day and 6 years apart from my birthday. And my grandpa was 87 when he died.

And 2016 has the number 16, that, besides being the upcoming day of my grandpa's birthday, was the beginning of a larger-scope revolution in politics, and reformed perceptions of the healthcare system, with the 2016 ascent of another, similar Jewish old-grandpa type character and role model to me, Bernie Sanders, who has some similarities to my grandpa. 

My grandma's numerical timing of when she died is a proof symbol in my opinion on the perception and characterized message of my grandpa's death involving the heart doctor seeming synchronistic: that the healthcare system needs reform. And the ascent of Bernie, whose name slantly rhymes with "Yury," synchronized in tune, means a lot to me about the need for reforming healthcare systems, not just in governance, but inside the systems themselves, from elderly care, to prescription habits, to the dietary and environment principles. 

### Massages

I had severe eczema, and my grandma, mom, and grandpa when I was a kid helped by giving the best massages. My grandma's were the best of the best of theirs.

<!--

## Ascent of a Jewish old grandpa

I’d heard about Bernie Sanders from reading about him on Facebook, and I met some supporters who’d even heard of him before his 2015 - 2016 presidential run. I was getting his campaign emails, it was still early in his campaign before the 2016 Democratic primaries, and I told my mom about him, that I wanted to donate from the link in a campaign email from him. She was worried, thinking it might be spam.

That wasn’t implausible, that a politician who her son is describing as actually caring about policies, with principles, who calls himself a "socialist" and is Jewish, and is making serious headway as a contender for the office of president in America, is some kind of trick.

It didn’t take long before she could see he was a serious and sincere "politician," and the word "politician" has to go in quotes, because Bernie’s "politics" are about actual governing.

My mom donated to him, too.

"Bernie Sanders" is a household name today, so much so that some people might roll their eyes, call me a "Bernie bro." But unlike the "Bernie bros" across the Democratic party leadership who have taken on his positions and rhetoric, without giving credit to the fact that they actively stood opposed to those very positions and rhetoric when Bernie was still bringing those views into the mainstream all his life, I’m a [Bernie "supporter,"](https://github.com/slerman12/Governance/blob/main/Does-Nature-Endorse%3F.md) not bro.

Those ideas, like Medicare For All, a $15 minimum wage, ending the corruption of Wall St., acknowledging the huge gap between "the top 1% and the 99%," have become popular talking points thanks to his campaigns (though the non-Bernie talking heads often leave out public funding of elections and overturning Citizens United), which made a bigger difference in American political knowledge and culture than any of the Democrats who campaigned against him, including the one who became president.

I don’t want to echo what has already been taught, and taught effectively, in both 2015/2016 and 2019/2020. This book requires an open mind because it points out issues and reforms that aren’t redundant to the ones Bernie has pointed out, in contexts that may seem familiar to one side or another ("Oh he's anti-medicine!", "Oh he's anti-science!", "Oh he's part of the 'woke mob'!"), but aren't.

<!--How to transition into this? Well, let’s start with my experience in the elderly-care unit.-->

## Geriatric Unit Hospitalization

Speaking of the elderly...

> [!WARNING]
> 
> In January, 2021, I had another hospitalization, my last hospitalization, the geriatric unit (elderly facility) one.
>
> I was leading another one of my advisor's students on a long-term memory paper called [Eclectic-Mem](https://github.com/slerman12/Eclectic-Mem) for my advisor, that I still had an extremely intense amount of work to do on in order to make the ICML deadline. My family members visited. I was again following some kind of yogic-trance, but this time, much less spiritually guided. I knew that the yogic state I'd been in before was real, and I didn't want to disobey the new flow that had taken over. I was acting strange in front of the visiting family members, and my mom called the ambulance. My behavior was strange enough that the responders decided to take me to the hospital, and as they were doing so, I broke from the obedience to that pseudo-flow state and started screaming to my mom that there was an ICML paper deadline that I had to submit to. This was still 2020, months after my first paper. The responders took me away, so far with no concrete reason to do so, but only my mom's call and the superficial strangeness of my behavior.
>
> In particular, what caused my mom to call the ambulance was I was doing stretches on the couch without talking to my relatives when they were talking to me. Then the strange behavior with responders, who I did talk to, and whose questions I answered normally, was that I was slightly reluctant to let them take my vitals — yes. And I quickly did let them take my vitals. They just caught that I had some reluctance and found that suspicious. So they dragged me to the ambulance, and I was screaming to my mom about the paper deadline as they did so. The ambulance drove me to the hospital, where first, they brought me to a lobby.
>
> In the lobby, the nurse pulled me behind a curtain and made me change clothes, and I didn't want to (was slightly reluctant), but she told me I had to. Then she sat me in a wheelchair. A nurse pushed it forward, it ran over my big toe that was situated in front of the wheel, and I screamed<!-- out specifically that my toe was run over-->. "My toe! My toe!" The nurse kept rolling me off, as she and the other nurses all ignored my screaming<!--, in what, surprisingly, didn't break my toe-->. My toe could've broken and they would've done nothing. 
>
> Next, they brought me to an open area filled with other patients, and told me I'd be transferred later that day.
>
> Each day I was told I'd be transferred that day or the next day. I had to sleep there in a chair for a week. The dungeon-like area was full, in every square foot of the open areas, with other patients, who slept on mattresses or also in chairs. The clinicians seemed to forget about me and still had no particular reason for the imprisonment.
>
> Besides the clothes they'd made me change into, I was given only highly processed foods to eat, foods that usually cause eczema, drugs including benzos, and periodic clinical visits from clinicians who could've been mistaken for military interrogators. Clinical authorities.
>
> None of them were consistent or attendant enough to see this, but I was in an increasingly sensitive state, as I was coerced through all of this, knowing-unjustly, and with no normal sleep for a week.
>
> After a week of sleeping in a chair, they transferred me to the geriatric unit (a facility for the elderly) on a different floor, their regular psychiatric units being full.
>
> Finally, they specified a reason for why they were holding me. Apparently my mom said I wasn't eating enough, which she later denied saying. Ironically, I was eating a lot. Usually 5 organic steaks and a salmon every day, about half of my income. I was lectured pretty heavily by a fat woman specialist about how carbs are a necessary part of a healthy diet. That was Winter, 2020/2021, perhaps just before diets like the keto diet gained scientific support, or maybe already after. During that hospitalization, chunks of my hair fell out. The rapid timing was extremely coincidental, so maybe the onset of the hair loss was independent to the hospitalization, or maybe a synchronicity, but most likely exacerbated, because I thought I was in Hell.
> 
> The anxiety was so extreme that my eczema became itchy just from that, if not the food. I ate all of their garbage food. I made special requests, but the diet they provided wasn't more than what you'd expect from hospital food, and always came with an abundance of chocolate Ensures, enough to probably buy a steak honestly.
> 
> Due to Covid, my family wasn't allowed to visit me.
>
> Of all the hospitalizations (excluding aftermath), the most traumatic was the geriatric unit one. And not because they ran over my toe with the wheelchair that I was in and ignored my <!--pained-->in-pain screams, nor the enclosed-dungeon area where they made me sleep in a chair for a week, eat stuff I was allergic too, take benzos temporarily again, and share living space amid lots of commotion and tons of people, but because of the geriatric unit they subsequently transferred me to. Old people. People I thought were sketchy. One friend, black guy I shared pudding crackers with at the window later, after, when I managed to get out of my room from the trauma of thinking I was in Hell. Other than that, coldness, Hell-setting, and, while I was still confined to my bed due to the intensity of the earlier dungeon area where they kept saying they'd transfer me to a room later that day and didn't for another week, I was under the delusion in that geriatric unit environment that I was literally in Hell, the beam of red light shining into my window from the neighboring hospital roof, being stuck in a floor with no nature, old lady in the room next door screaming "Oh Christia! Oh Christia!" every day, only plastic and children's colors and an artificial picture painting across from my door. And I had a whole bed and bathroom to myself, but still. The nurses and staff were fine, but the environment was bad.
>
> That was the geriatric unit hospitalization, psychiatric wards were full, ran over my toe, they kept me in an open-room with other patients, and then after <!--like-->about a week of me sleeping in a chair, they transferred me to a geriatric unit, with me unable to leave my bed <!--through New Year's--> because I thought I was in Hell, once they situated me in that geriatric unit room, no visitors. They had no knowledge of that Hell thinking, nor was that my state of thinking coming into the hospitalization. 
>
> In the hospitalization between the benzo-trauma inititiating one and this one, ["Hospitalization 3,"](8-Holy-Faith.md#comedic-aside-sexier-moments-during-chenliang-advising) (see ["Psyche Hospitalization"](8-Holy-Faith.md#comedic-aside-sexier-moments-during-chenliang-advising)) I was able to spit out the benzos they were giving me. I wasn't risking the tongue trick from before to spit out the benzos, here, Hospitalization 4 (and last). I wasn't in that kind of flow state. But later, when they gave me a Covid mask, in the geriatric unit, which I don't recall if they did while in the open area with other patients, I got to spit the benzos out into that. This was after Hospitalizations 1 and 2 of taking them only as prescribed which caused the more than year long benzo trauma.
>
> I think they did a Covid test before transferring me, though I don't recall one. I'm just inferring, since it was a geriatric unit (a unit for the elderly). Yes, I recall mention of a Covid test. I don't know if it was before or after the dungeon-area.
>
> To summarize:
> - `My big toe was painfully run over by the nurse, and ignored`, no attention paid, disregarded screaming.
> - `I had to sleep in a chair in a shared open area filled with other patients for a week` with only scary clinical authorities who came around occasionally to interrogate me, drugs handed to me, and `with food mostly only that I was allergic to`, while in an increasingly sensitive state, and `being told I'd be transferred to a room later that day or the next day.`
> - I was transferred to a geriatric unit, with almost nobody my age, and an environment that lacked any nature, with only synthetic plastics, no genuine warmth, and an abundance of chocolate Ensures.
> - `I was lectured about not eating enough carbs, and that was their specified reason for holding me.`
> - `My hair was falling out into my hands and my eczema returned.`
>
> Some crazy-person advice: Clinicians should stop using the expression "I'm gonna take your vitals," because when a patient thinks they're in Hell, that is a terrifying thing to hear. Then they have no choice but to let those clinicians strap them or inject them or whatever, and their mind possibly is tuned to a ritual level of thinking where symbolism has extreme sacred meaning. The symbolism of "vitals" being "taken," in the context of vampyrism or losing a loved one, isn't good. Just a suggestion. 
>
> While drugged with benzos in the enclosed-dungeon area, my brain went from that strange pseudo-schizotypal paranoia I began in to a full blown "I'm literally condemned here forever and this is literally a robot dimension or Hell" state.
>
> Since Winter, 2021, I haven't had another long-term hospitalization<!-- not had another serious or psychiatric hospitalization-->. There was one hospitalization half a year later, in which I was there for half a day<!--, and I convinced them I was high on MDMA and mentioned one of their names eerily and that I was writing a book (a different book, at the time, about deep learning) as they were picking me up from the park they found me camping in my car in, where they actually left my car, unlocked and unattended, with all of my stuff, against my will, that my mom and uncle had to pick up after it was towed (independent to the police or ambulance, and without my attendance, since they took me against my will, could've been robbed of all of my stuff, expensive stuff I had in there, including my laptop) since the reason they found me is because I was parked there all night, the police thought I was behaving strangely since I was talking to them with an unusual confidence and energy in the morning when they found me, and called the ambulance, who took me without any delay or consideration to the fact that my car was there, unlocked, coercively, again, as I also couldn't mention because I wasn't thinking about my car while trying to convince them not to take me, and I hadn't actually done anything besides appearing strange to police, the only people who were there, in a park next to Durand beach, where people technically aren't allowed to be at night, but people do, and, normally aren't detained for it--><!--but they neither held me there nor believed there was any psychiatric issue-->. But despite being in a deep and sacred state, I said I was high on MDMA, they believed me, and they let me out after just half a day. The geriatric unit hospitalization was traumatizing, but that's not the reason why I successfully avoided future imprisonments, nor the instance of the half-day hospitalization<!-- where I got out of it by claiming something that wasn't true but still was ruled as being in too psychologically deviating a state so as to call an ambulance, and be taken by them against my will screaming the whole way in protest to the coercion towards detainment, already traumatized from the previous time via the geriatric unit, as they decided I needed hospitalization. I think the main reason it was only half a day was the actual substantive content of what I was screaming, very specific, about my book, and since I saw one of the name tags of the people there, I said his name while not looking in his direction nonchalantly-->. <!--After the ambulance, I was in a bed for a short nap. I even did a hand-waving dance while there, in front of all of them, still psychotic, and they didn't look into it. Discharged after half a day. I didn't leave my psychosis for a second, before, during (unless a nap counts), or after. Sincerely. And calling it psychosis is wrong. I was obeying something, and got leave because of that obedience.-->My ability to live with those schizophrenic states (trances, including less trustworthy ones), consciously and drug-free, increased to the point that they aren't schizophrenic states, but unambiguous connections to a deeper wisdom (or, some "intelligence" of some kind, depending what social influences are most authoritatively in my life). [Humans and other cultures have been integrating that wisdom long before hospitals existed.](https://youtu.be/CFtsHf1lVI4?si=c7HOzpchsB2NeP1-) Though the geriatric unit hospitalization wasn't a good example, nor necessarily the half-day hospitalization I had half a year later, which was my very last hospitalization, I was and have become pretty good at navigating those states of consciousness and integrating them in the moment, usefully, creatively, and sometimes powerfully<!-- (thereafter)-->.

At the end of [A Beautiful Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind_(film)), the nobel prizewinner with schizophrenia, John Nash, is depicted as achieving stability by taking his medications. The real John Nash objected to them, and lived pretty much his entire life unmedicated, starting from long before he came up with the work that led to his winning the Nobel Prize. While the movie's depiction is somehow extremely romantic to medical systems, it's inaccurate to the true history of how he surmounted his diagnoses. ["In Sylvia Nasar's book with the same title, on which the film is based, it is clearly stated that Nash stopped taking medication in 1970 because of the way it blunted his intellect. The change was apparently made because the screenwriter, Akiva Goldsman, whose mother was a prominent psychologist, was worried that the film might persuade people to stop taking their medication."](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/02/dont-use-john-nash-schizophrenia-a-beautiful-mind-promote-anti-psychotics) Yes, the film based on a true story might persuade people wrongly. So better fabricate it. ["in a scene [around the time of the character's Nobel Prize nomination in 1994], Russell Crowe explicitly credits his recovery [...] to newer medication. The truth is that Nash stopped taking any medication in 1970. The line is a fabrication, and a conscious one."](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/02/dont-use-john-nash-schizophrenia-a-beautiful-mind-promote-anti-psychotics)

> ["Nash described sanity as a form of conformity, and one about which he maintained a degree of ambivalence. 'So, at the present time, I seem to be thinking rationally in the style that is characteristic of scientists,' he wrote. 'However, this is not entirely a matter of joy, as if someone returned from physical disability to good physical health. One aspect of this is that rationality of thought imposes a limit on a person's concept of his relation to the cosmos.' There can be no doubt that to talk in such terms requires both honesty and tremendous courage. The question is whether we have the courage to hear him."](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/02/dont-use-john-nash-schizophrenia-a-beautiful-mind-promote-anti-psychotics)

To do: Make a diagram specifically for geriatric unit hospitalization (University of Rochester's Strong Hospital).

Chronology: Lobby wheelchair toe -> open-area chair sleeping with processed eczema-causing food, more coerced benzos, and interrogative military clinicians -> geriatric unit -> them arguing carbs were a necessary part of a healthy diet and stating that the reason for holding me in that hospitalization was that I wasn't eating enough (even as I ate all of their garbage food).

## Second Induced Hair Loss

Full head hair regrowth in Alopecia Universalis, especially with comorbid eczema, is extremely medically rare. 

By the time of [Hospitlization 3](8-Holy-Faith.md#comedic-aside-sexier-moments-during-chenliang-advising) (the one previous to the geriatric unit), I was on a mostly-steak-only diet since at least as far back as June, 2020 (with wild-caught salmon as well), which I remember since at that time I was working on my Taylor-CAM paper, but probably back to May or April.

See [here](4-Faith.md#mikhaila-peterson) for where I'd initially heard of this diet from. Specifically, the diet I heard of and read about was "beef-only."

The first month of that diet included many unwanted but temporary and [expected](https://carnivoresnax.com/blogs/articles/side-effects-of-carnivore-diet?srsltid=AfmBOooxOb6gWQrauNAH3Eqc9rI2AqqSU61Tp1dTbRSRpzqtyBlfsMFP) physical symptoms.

<!--Previous to the final version of my diet, beginning initially from Paleo, I transitioned to (organic) beef-only. The organic-beef-only phase was about a month and caused watery bowel movement symptoms and decreased stool frequency, as were expected from what I'd heard and read about the diet. By the end of that month, I think my energy and mood, and probably cognition, had massively improved. Gradually, the majority of my beef came from organic, grass fed, grass-finished steak and not long after, perhaps in that month as well, I added daily salmon in the morning.-->
Beginning from Paleo, I switched to organic beef-only, which is what I read and heard about, and, within that month or after a month, I added occasional salmon.

My diet converged to about one wild-caught salmon each morning and about 5 organic, grass fed, grass-finished steaks per day, and organic black pepper and salt, and water. I used lots of salt and fried the fat from the steak. 

I experienced big improvements to my cognition, energy, and mood. <!--In particular, I recall my writing, not academic but poems, visual creative writing, and texts to people, had improved that summer to beyond even where they were before the benzo brain damage. Most of my income was going towards this experimental recovering, meant to improve my head from the benzo-induced impairments — and, unexpectedly, my hair started to grow back while on that diet within the next couple months. I was also practicing other disciplines, including meditating, calisthenics, and abstaining from porn, all of which I continued from previous to this diet.--> Note: not necessarily eczema.

2 years after no hair on my body, my head hair started growing back, strands and patches at a time<!--, coinciding with the observable physical and cognitive changes of that diet-->.

In the hospitalization before the geriatric unit, [Hospitalization 3 (October, 2020)](8-Holy-Faith.md#comedic-aside-sexier-moments-during-chenliang-advising), [Mobi](4-Opposing-Views.md#kids) remarked on my hair when we saw a Duplumab commercial and I mentioned that the drug made me lose my hair ("oh that's why," he said, since it still looked odd not having grown back in parts). 

I was walking around bravely sometimes, past all of the nurses and patients, from my room to the phone without hat. 

<!-- - The causal mechanisms of all of these independent, non-local phenomena don't erase the divergent statistical odds of their synchronous timings. -->
  
- [Hospitalization 3 (October, 2020)](8-Holy-Faith.md#comedic-aside-sexier-moments-during-chenliang-advising) had given me a lot of junk food and I was eating lots of sweets after, as well, still on the dietary momentum from that hospitalization, even chocolate-chip cookies and cakes and things like that, somewhat addictively. But then I resumed strict discipline and a steak-primarily diet maybe a month or so after. I think steak/salmon-only. Amazingly, my eczema didn't return during the hospitalization or after, but that break in my disciplined diet, largely induced by the hospital, could've been what caused or heavily contributed to the sudden hair loss again, that happened in Hospitalization 4, the geriatric unit. 
- Prior to any millimeter of hair regrowth, I'd even fasted before my hair started growing back, so strict discipline wasn't what caused it to fall out in December. But fasting is unlikely to have been what caused it to grow back. It was a prolonged fast, about 7 days. I did 3 prolonged fasts in my life. Only that one corresponded (later) with hair regrowth. During that period, otherwise, before and during the onset of my hair regrowth prior to hospital food, I was only doing steak/salmon-only diet strictly.
<!--
Maybe: - Warning: If one is not physically active, the steak diet and keto diets in general might not be good for eczema, from experience. They give energy, and if that energy isn’t activated into physical movement, I find it turns into tearing at the skin.

[In the next hospitalization, in the geriatric unit](#geriatric-unit-hospitalization), there was a guy my age. I sat with him every day towards my last days there at the window. He and I talked. We were talking about deep things. I told him about my self-consciousness about my hair, since chunks of it were falling out again in that geriatric unit, and he said he couldn't even tell anything was bald. I think he even had some balding that he showed me, and said that he loses hair all the time, that my hair looked good, and not to worry. In other words, my hair had fully grown back, enough to pass the eye test of a guy sitting right next to me. *My head hair had fully grown back.*

But, in case the detail was missed ("since chunks of it were falling out again in that [geriatric unit](#geriatric-unit-hospitalization)"), it was there that it turned out to be falling out again, and proceeded to partially for months after, to the point that now it looks worse than it would've had it never grown back. I have to shave it from my head, something I don't like doing, to maintain the bald upper bound of my current mutilated appearance, that otherwise now grows in in patches, with more bald skin than hairy skin. That is exponentially worse than the first time they caused my hair to fall out.

`My hair was induced to fall out again after I regrew it through hard and expensive discipline, resulting in an Alopecia Areata that looks exponentially worse than the previous Alopecia Universalis.`

Despite my self-consciousness, for the most part, I didn't wear a hat during that hospitalization, so many people saw my head. My mom said, "I didn't think you need it" over the phone when I got mad at her for not dropping it off when she dropped off one steak in a plastic Tupperware. I was lectured about not eating enough carbs (which steak doesn't have) by one of the hospital staff. They required I eat carbs for me to be discharged, since they <!--said-->decided my diet, was why I was being held<!--, and specifically that my mom told them I wasn't eating enough (which she denied)-->. <!--This requirement was already after the week in the enclosed-dungeon area.-->

My hair was falling into my hands again in the [geriatric unit in January, 2021](#geriatric-unit-hospitalization), most likely because of the practices in that coerced hospital stay or the temporary dietary consequences of the previous coerced hospital stay.

That sudden hair regrowth was, miraculously, more than 2 years after the Dupilumab cessation that induced the Alopecia Universalis, and covered my head.
