## Geriatric Unit Hospitalization

Speaking of the elderly...

### Stretching, Vitals, and Ambulance

In January, 2021, I had another hospitalization, my last hospitalization, the geriatric unit (elderly facility) one.

I was leading another one of my advisor's, Chenliang's, students on a long-term memory paper called [Eclectic-Mem](https://github.com/slerman12/Eclectic-Mem) for my advisor, that I still had an extremely intense amount of work to do on in order to make the ICML deadline. My family members visited, my uncle Sasha my mom's cousin, his wife my aunt Vera, my uncle Sláva, and his wife my aunt Jenya. I was again following some kind of yogic-trance, but this time, much less spiritually guided. I knew that the yogic state I'd been in before was real, and I didn't want to disobey the new flow that had taken over. I was acting strange in front of the visiting family members, and my mom called the ambulance. My behavior was strange enough that the responders decided to take me to the hospital, and as they were doing so, I broke from the obedience to that pseudo-flow state and started screaming to my mom that there was an ICML paper deadline that I had to submit to. This was still January, 2021, months after my first paper. The responders took me away, so far with no concrete reason to do so, but only my mom's call and the superficial strangeness of my behavior.

In particular, what caused my mom to call the ambulance was I was doing stretches on the couch without talking to my relatives when they were talking to me. Then the strange behavior with responders, who I did talk to, and whose questions I answered normally, was that I was slightly reluctant to let them take my vitals — yes. And I quickly did let them take my vitals. They just caught that I had some reluctance and found that suspicious. So they dragged me to the ambulance, and I was screaming to my mom about the paper deadline as they did so. The ambulance drove me to the hospital, where first, they brought me to a lobby.

### Towed Toe and Ignored

In the lobby, the nurse pulled me behind a curtain and made me change clothes, and I didn't want to (was slightly reluctant), but she told me I had to. Then she sat me in a wheelchair. A nurse pushed it forward, it ran over my big toe that was (apparently, not by intention) situated in front of the wheel, and I screamed<!-- out specifically that my toe was run over-->. "My toe! My toe!" The nurse kept rolling me off, as she and the other nurses all ignored my screaming<!--, in what, surprisingly, didn't break my toe-->. My toe could've broken<!-- and they didn't care--><!--, would've done nothing if it was-->. 

### Sleeping in a Chair in an Enclosed Area Full to the Floors and Walls with Other Patients for About a Week

Next, they brought me to an open area filled with other patients, and told me I'd be transferred later that day.

Each day I was told I'd be transferred that day or the next day. I had to sleep there in a chair for a week. The dungeon-like area was full, in every square foot of the open areas, with other patients, who slept on mattresses or also in chairs. The clinicians seemed to forget about me and still had no particular reason for the imprisonment.

<!--The chairs were small, there were no beds, only small chairs and mattresses.-->

### Military Drills

Besides the clothes they'd made me change into, I was given only highly processed foods to eat, foods that usually cause eczema, drugs including benzos, and periodic clinical visits from clinicians who could've been mistaken for military interrogators. Clinical authorities.

None of them were consistent or attendant enough to see this, but I was in an increasingly sensitive state, as I was coerced through all of this, knowing-unjustly, and with no normal sleep for a week and more.

### Transfer to Geriatric Unit After About a Week

After a week of sleeping in a chair, they transferred me to the geriatric unit (a facility for the elderly) on a different floor, their regular psychiatric units being full.

### Improvised Reason for Detainment, and not a Good One, <!--Coerced Carbs as-->Bad Required Remedy, and Hair Loss

Finally, they specified a reason for why they were holding me. Apparently my mom said I wasn't eating enough, which she later denied saying. Ironically, I was eating a lot. Usually 5 organic steaks and a salmon every day, about half of my income. I was lectured pretty heavily by a fat woman specialist about how carbs are a necessary part of a healthy diet. That was earliest Winter, 2021, perhaps just before diets like the keto diet gained scientific support, or maybe already after. During that hospitalization, chunks of my hair fell out. The rapid timing was extremely coincidental, so maybe the onset of the hair loss was independent to the hospitalization, or maybe a synchronicity, but most likely exacerbated, because I thought I was in Hell.

The anxiety was so extreme that my eczema became itchy just from that, if not the food. I ate all of their garbage food. I made special requests, but the diet they provided wasn't more than what you'd expect from hospital food, and always came with an abundance of chocolate Ensures, enough to probably buy a steak<!-- honestly-->.

### No Visits 

Due to Covid, my family wasn't allowed to visit me.

### Hell Environment

Of all the hospitalizations (excluding aftermath), the most traumatic was the geriatric unit one. And not because they ran over my toe with the wheelchair that I was in and ignored my <!--pained-->in-pain screams, nor the enclosed-dungeon area where they made me sleep in a chair for a week, eat stuff I was allergic too, take benzos temporarily again, and share living space amid lots of commotion and tons of people, but because of the geriatric unit they subsequently transferred me to. Old people. People I thought were sketchy. One friend, black guy I shared pudding crackers with at the window later, after, when I managed to get out of my room from the trauma of thinking I was in Hell. Other than that, coldness, Hell-setting, and, while I was still confined to my bed due to the intensity of the earlier dungeon area where they kept saying they'd transfer me to a room later that day and didn't for about another week, I was under the delusion in that geriatric unit environment that I was literally in Hell, the beam of red light shining into my window from the neighboring hospital roof, being stuck in a floor with no nature, old lady in the room next door screaming "Oh Christia! Oh Christia!" every day, only plastic and children's colors and an artificial picture painting across from my door. And I had a whole bed and bathroom to myself, but still. The nurses and staff were fine, but the environment was bad.

That was the geriatric unit hospitalization, psychiatric wards were full, ran over my toe, they kept me in an open-room with other patients, and then after <!--like-->about a week of me sleeping in a chair, they transferred me to a geriatric unit, with me unable to leave my bed <!--through New Year's--> because I thought I was in Hell, once they situated me in that geriatric unit room, no visitors. They had no knowledge of that Hell thinking, nor was that my state of thinking coming into the hospitalization. 

### Covid Measures

In the hospitalization between the benzo-trauma inititiating one and this one, ["Hospitalization 3,"](4-Holy-Faith/Psyche.md#comedic-aside-sexier-moments-during-chenliang-advising) (see ["Psyche Hospitalization"](4-Holy-Faith/Psyche.md#comedic-aside-sexier-moments-during-chenliang-advising)) I was able to spit out the benzos they were giving me. I wasn't risking the tongue trick from before to spit out the benzos, here, Hospitalization 4<!-- (and last)-->. I wasn't in that kind of flow state. But later, when they gave me a Covid mask, in the geriatric unit, which I don't recall if they did while in the open area with other patients (they didn't; I recall a specific memory; they didn't, any of us), I got to spit the benzos out into that. This was after Hospitalizations 1 and 2 of taking them only as prescribed which caused the more than year long benzo trauma.

I think they did a Covid test before transferring me, though I don't recall one. I'm just inferring, since it was a geriatric unit (a unit for the elderly). Yes, I recall mention of a Covid test. I don't know if it was before or after the dungeon-area.

### To Summarize:

- `My big toe was painfully run over by the nurse, and ignored`, no attention paid, disregarded screaming.
- `I had to sleep in a chair in a shared open area filled with other patients for a week` with only scary clinical authorities who came around occasionally to interrogate me, drugs handed to me, and `with food mostly only that I was allergic to`, while in an increasingly sensitive state, and `being told I'd be transferred to a room later that day or the next day.`
- I was transferred to a geriatric unit, with almost nobody my age, and an environment that lacked any nature, with only synthetic plastics, no genuine warmth, and an abundance of chocolate Ensures.
- `I was lectured about not eating enough carbs, and that was their specified reason for holding me.`
- `My hair was falling out into my hands and my eczema returned.`

Some crazy-person advice: Clinicians should stop using the expression "I'm gonna take your vitals," because when a patient thinks they're in Hell, that is a terrifying thing to hear. Then they have no choice but to let those clinicians strap them or inject them or whatever, and their mind possibly is tuned to a ritual level of thinking where symbolism has extreme sacred meaning. The symbolism of "vitals" being "taken," in the context of vampyrism or losing a loved one, isn't good. Just a suggestion. 

While drugged with benzos in the enclosed-dungeon area, my brain went from that strange pseudo-schizotypal paranoia I began in to a full blown "I'm literally condemned here forever and this is literally a robot dimension or Hell" state.

### Living in Threat for My Conciousness

Since Winter, 2021, I haven't had another long-term hospitalization<!-- not had another serious or psychiatric hospitalization-->. There was one hospitalization half a year later, in which I was there for half a day<!--, and I convinced them I was high on MDMA and mentioned one of their names eerily and that I was writing a book (a different book, at the time, about deep learning) as they were picking me up from the park they found me camping in my car in, where they actually left my car, unlocked and unattended, with all of my stuff, against my will, that my mom and uncle had to pick up after it was towed (independent to the police or ambulance, and without my attendance, since they took me against my will, could've been robbed of all of my stuff, expensive stuff I had in there, including my laptop) since the reason they found me is because I was parked there all night, the police thought I was behaving strangely since I was talking to them with an unusual confidence and energy in the morning when they found me, and called the ambulance, who took me without any delay or consideration to the fact that my car was there, unlocked, coercively, again, as I also couldn't mention because I wasn't thinking about my car while trying to convince them not to take me, and I hadn't actually done anything besides appearing strange to police, the only people who were there, in a park next to Durand beach, where people technically aren't allowed to be at night, but people do, and, normally aren't detained for it--><!--but they neither held me there nor believed there was any psychiatric issue-->. But despite being in a deep and sacred state, I said I was high on MDMA, they believed me, and they let me out after just half a day. The geriatric unit hospitalization was traumatizing, but that's not the reason why I successfully avoided future imprisonments, nor the instance of the half-day hospitalization<!-- where I got out of it by claiming something that wasn't true but still was ruled as being in too psychologically deviating a state so as to call an ambulance, and be taken by them against my will screaming the whole way in protest to the coercion towards detainment, already traumatized from the previous time via the geriatric unit, as they decided I needed hospitalization. I think the main reason it was only half a day was the actual substantive content of what I was screaming, very specific, about my book, and since I saw one of the name tags of the people there, I said his name while not looking in his direction nonchalantly-->. <!--After the ambulance, I was in a bed for a short nap. I even did a hand-waving dance while there, in front of all of them, still psychotic, and they didn't look into it. Discharged after half a day. I didn't leave my psychosis for a second, before, during (unless a nap counts), or after. Sincerely. And calling it psychosis is wrong. I was obeying something, and got leave because of that obedience.-->My ability to live with those schizophrenic states (trances, including less trustworthy ones), consciously and drug-free, increased to the point that they aren't schizophrenic states, but unambiguous connections to a deeper wisdom (or, some "intelligence" of some kind, depending what social influences are most authoritatively in my life). [Humans and other cultures have been integrating that wisdom long before hospitals existed.](https://youtu.be/CFtsHf1lVI4?si=c7HOzpchsB2NeP1-) Though the geriatric unit hospitalization wasn't a good example, nor necessarily the half-day hospitalization I had half a year later, which was my very last hospitalization, I was and have become pretty good at navigating those states of consciousness and integrating them in the moment, usefully, creatively, and sometimes powerfully<!-- (thereafter)-->.

That appreciation is rarely seen in modern medicine.

Nor Hollywood, even. At the end of [A Beautiful Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind_(film)), the nobel prizewinner with schizophrenia, John Nash, is depicted as achieving stability by taking his medications. The real John Nash objected to them, and lived pretty much his entire life unmedicated, starting from long before he came up with the work that led to his winning the Nobel Prize. While the movie's depiction is somehow extremely romantic to medical systems, it's inaccurate to the true history of how he surmounted his diagnoses. ["In Sylvia Nasar's book with the same title, on which the film is based, it is clearly stated that Nash stopped taking medication in 1970 because of the way it blunted his intellect. The change was apparently made because the screenwriter, Akiva Goldsman, whose mother was a prominent psychologist, was worried that the film might persuade people to stop taking their medication."](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/02/dont-use-john-nash-schizophrenia-a-beautiful-mind-promote-anti-psychotics) Yes, the film based on a true story might persuade people wrongly. So better fabricate it. ["in a scene [around the time of the character's Nobel Prize nomination in 1994], Russell Crowe explicitly credits his recovery [...] to newer medication. The truth is that Nash stopped taking any medication in 1970. The line is a fabrication, and a conscious one."](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/02/dont-use-john-nash-schizophrenia-a-beautiful-mind-promote-anti-psychotics)

["Nash described sanity as a form of conformity, and one about which he maintained a degree of ambivalence. 'So, at the present time, I seem to be thinking rationally in the style that is characteristic of scientists,' he wrote. 'However, this is not entirely a matter of joy, as if someone returned from physical disability to good physical health. One aspect of this is that rationality of thought imposes a limit on a person's concept of his relation to the cosmos.' There can be no doubt that to talk in such terms requires both honesty and tremendous courage. The question is whether we have the courage to hear him."](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/02/dont-use-john-nash-schizophrenia-a-beautiful-mind-promote-anti-psychotics)

## Second Induced Hair Loss

Full head hair regrowth in Alopecia Universalis, especially with comorbid eczema, is extremely medically rare. 

By the time of [Hospitlization 3](4-Holy-Faith/Psyche.md#comedic-aside-sexier-moments-during-chenliang-advising) (the one previous to the geriatric unit), I was on a mostly-steak-only diet since at least as far back as June, 2020 (with wild-caught salmon as well), which I remember since at that time I was working on my Taylor-CAM paper, but probably back to May or April.

[See here](2-Medical-Malpractices.md#jordan-peterson) for where I'd initially heard of this diet from, Jordan Peterson's daughter, Michaela Fuller. Specifically, the diet I heard of from her and read about was the "beef-only" diet or "carnivore," and for her consisted mostly of high-end steak.

The first month of that diet included many unwanted but temporary and [expected](https://carnivoresnax.com/blogs/articles/side-effects-of-carnivore-diet?srsltid=AfmBOooxOb6gWQrauNAH3Eqc9rI2AqqSU61Tp1dTbRSRpzqtyBlfsMFP) physical symptoms.

<!--Previous to the final version of my diet, beginning initially from Paleo, I transitioned to (organic) beef-only. The organic-beef-only phase was about a month and caused watery bowel movement symptoms and decreased stool frequency, as were expected from what I'd heard and read about the diet. By the end of that month, I think my energy and mood, and probably cognition, had massively improved. Gradually, the majority of my beef came from organic, grass fed, grass-finished steak and not long after, perhaps in that month as well, I added daily salmon in the morning.-->
Beginning from Paleo, I switched to organic beef-only, which is what I heard and read about, and, within that month or after a month, I added occasional salmon.

My diet converged to about one wild-caught salmon each morning and about 5 organic, grass fed, grass-finished steaks per day, and organic black pepper and salt, and water. I used lots of salt and fried the fat from the steak. 

I experienced big improvements to my cognition, energy, and mood. <!--In particular, I recall my writing, not academic but poems, visual creative writing, and texts to people, had improved that summer to beyond even where they were before the benzo brain damage. Most of my income was going towards this experimental recovering, meant to improve my head from the benzo-induced impairments — and, unexpectedly, my hair started to grow back while on that diet within the next couple months. I was also practicing other disciplines, including meditating, calisthenics, and abstaining from porn, all of which I continued from previous to this diet.--> Note: not necessarily eczema (though no flare-ups either).

2 years after no hair on my body, my head hair started growing back suddenly, strands and patches at a time<!--, coinciding with the observable physical and cognitive changes of that diet-->, and kept growing.

In the hospitalization before the geriatric unit, [Hospitalization 3 (October, 2020)](4-Holy-Faith/Psyche.md#comedic-aside-sexier-moments-during-chenliang-advising), [Mobi](4-PhD-Faculty-Malpractices-2#kids) remarked on my hair when we saw a Duplumab commercial and I mentioned that the drug made me lose my hair ("Oh that's why," he said, putting the dots together, since it still looked odd not having grown back in parts). 

I was walking around bravely, past all of the nurses and patients, from my room to the phone without hat, from time to time. 

<!-- - The causal mechanisms of all of these independent, non-local phenomena don't erase the divergent statistical odds of their synchronous timings. -->
  
- [Hospitalization 3 (October, 2020)](4-Holy-Faith/Psyche.md#comedic-aside-sexier-moments-during-chenliang-advising) had given me a lot of junk food and I was eating lots of sweets after, as well, still on the dietary momentum from that hospitalization, even chocolate-chip cookies and cakes and things like that, somewhat addictively. But then I resumed strict discipline and a steak-primarily diet maybe a month or so after. I think steak/salmon-only. Amazingly, my eczema didn't return during the hospitalization or after, but that break in my disciplined diet, largely induced by the hospital, could've been what caused or heavily contributed to the sudden hair loss again, that happened in [Hospitalization 4 (January, 2021)](#geriatric-unit-hospitalization), the geriatric unit. 
- Prior to any millimeter of hair regrowth, I'd even fasted before my hair started growing back, so strict discipline wasn't what caused it to fall out in January. But fasting is unlikely to have been what caused it to grow back. It was a prolonged fast, about 7 days. I did 3 prolonged fasts in my life. Only that one corresponded (later) with hair regrowth. During that period, otherwise, before and during the onset of my hair regrowth prior to hospital food, I was only doing steak/salmon-only diet strictly.
<!--
Maybe: - Warning: If one is not physically active, the steak diet and keto diets in general might not be good for eczema, from experience. They give energy, and if that energy isn’t activated into physical movement, I find it turns into tearing at the skin. 
-->

[In the next hospitalization, in the geriatric unit](#geriatric-unit-hospitalization), there was a guy my age. I sat with him every day towards my last days there at the window. He and I talked. We were talking about deep things. I told him about my self-consciousness about my hair, [since chunks of it were falling out again in that geriatric unit](#improvised-reason-for-detainment-and-not-a-good-one-coerced-carbs-as-required-remedy-and-hair-loss), and he said he couldn't even tell anything was bald. I think he even had some balding that he showed me, and said that he loses hair all the time, that my hair looked good, and not to worry. In other words, my hair had fully grown back, enough to pass the eye test of a guy sitting right next to me. *My head hair had fully grown back.*

But, in case the detail was missed ("since chunks of it were falling out again in that geriatric unit," it was there that it turned out to be falling out again, and proceeded to partially for months after, to the point that now it looks worse than it would've had it never grown back. I have to shave it from my head, something I don't like doing, to maintain the bald upper bound of my current mutilated appearance, that otherwise now grows in in patches, with more bald skin than hairy skin. That is exponentially worse than the first time they caused my hair to fall out.

`My hair was induced to fall out again after I regrew it through hard and expensive discipline, resulting in an Alopecia Areata that looks exponentially worse than the previous Alopecia Universalis.`

Despite my self-consciousness, for the most part, I didn't wear a hat during that hospitalization, so many people saw my head. My mom said, "I didn't think you need it" over the phone when I got mad at her for not dropping it off when she dropped off one steak in a plastic Tupperware. I was lectured about not eating enough carbs (which steak doesn't have) by one of the hospital staff. They required I eat carbs for me to be discharged, since they <!--said-->decided my diet, was why I was being held<!--, and specifically that my mom told them I wasn't eating enough (which she denied)-->. <!--This requirement was already after the week in the enclosed-dungeon area.-->

My hair was falling into my hands again in the [geriatric unit in January, 2021](#geriatric-unit-hospitalization), most likely because of the practices in that coerced hospital stay or the temporary dietary consequences of the previous coerced hospital stay.

That sudden hair regrowth was, miraculously, more than 2 years after the Dupilumab cessation that induced the Alopecia Universalis, and covered my head.
