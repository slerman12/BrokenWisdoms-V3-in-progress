- I started losing my hair in my 1st year
- I started taking benzos in my 2nd year
- I started working in Chenliang Xu's lab nearing the end of my 3rd year

<!--Chenliang was an associate professor, younger than Henry.--><!--, and didn't have tenure yet, but would obtain tenure and a firstborn in the coming years.-->

At the time of asking to join Chenliang's lab, the end of my 3rd year (near the end of Spring semester, 2020, before the university began Covid lockdowns), I had no publications.

Chenliang gave me an ultimatum: Submit a top-venue *Computer Vision* paper by end of summer, without pay, or no acceptance. Had I failed to do that, I wouldn't have an advisor or pay, and most likely, would've been terminated.

I presented Semantic Segmentation with MHDPA applied to image features. That, applied to a Computer Vision domain specifically, would've been the first Vision Transformer, but there wasn't enough time to build and benchmark that with the pressure and deadline from Chenliang.

I had to work at the Med Center concurrently for funding, since Chenliang wasn't paying me, and had to spend at least a month giving my nights and weekends to achieving his ultimatum by the summer, 2020 NeurIPS deadline.

He also said I'd have to come in every day to do that work in his lab, which I ended up not having to do due to the lockdowns.

He accepted me into his lab when I successfully delivered that [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08601), my first published paper, "Taylor-CAM"<!--(*name modified here for reason that will become apparent*)-->, ended up getting positive reviews, rejected, and then later accepted at ICCV, a top-venue conference (in AI, conferences are bigger than journals, and that was quite a feat for a few months, in a brand new research area, switching fields from "medical prognostication" to "state of the art Computer Vision").

It's ironic also that when he announced his desertion (due to not having published enough papers in that time frame), on ****07/24/2023****, 3 years later, I was in the middle of a paper review with positive reviews, [that got accepted](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-023-01164-8), another published paper.

During those 3 years, for the most part, Chenliang didn't directly fund me. At first I worked at the Medical Center. Then, he put me on a Mechanical Engineering lab, where I didn't work *instead of* his ordinary group requirements, but entirely on top of. In fact, none of the 3 committee members who the deciding Judge, and CS department Chair Michael Scott, attributed to my termination in my 6th year, addressed or acknowledged that I was working for and receiving funding for my work from the Mechanical Engineering department at the time, not from CS (meaning, the people who'll later terminate me, weren't the people giving me my paid work, technically at nearly any point; even prior to Chenliang was Med Center and a NSF NRT stipend that I applied for).

<!--Also during those 3 years, Chenliang [got tenure](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b064fc1d-d941-4d9c-8b51-ec3390f827c8), had his first child, and boasted his Computer Vision lab's high publication ranking on CSRankings during that 3-year period.-->

Meanwhile, under Niaz, in the Mechanical Engineering department, specifically Materials Science, I produced exactly the paper rate that she wanted, and through really hard work to make sure the ideas, experiments, grant-writing, data, and programming were all really high quality ([here is the GitHub repo I built for us](https://github.com/AGI-init/XRDs)).

Last-minute, and with almost no notice, and without Niaz's approval, Chenliang wanted to allocate that Mechanical Engineering-work funding to someone else, due to me not providing enough publications in his Computer Vision group. Yes that funding that I helped earn — literally — through the programming and grant ideas and grant writing and grant diagrams, definitively leading and exceptionally implementing the AI side of the work on which all of the models were built and experiments were run and plotted, as well as running and plotting the experiments, and with support and appreciation from the rest of the group as I taught them deep learning in each of our meetings every week, which included Chenliang — that funding to someone else. He'd given me no prior warning or indication of dissatisfaction. Quite the opposite actually.

As Niaz said, "I don't know what he was thinking."

### AI
  
AI has many dangerous applications, from [scamming people](https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/how-deepfake-version-of-elon-musk-became-internet-s-biggest-scammer-124081402000_1.html), to mass-production [homogenization](https://youtu.be/NzDpj2K1dKk?si=Wwi91GElMFm7XElw) in [manufacturing](8-Holy-Faith.md#mass-production-of-mass-production--anti-homogenization-and-monopolization), to [devaluing talent and hard work](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/3/pgae052/7618478), to [concentrating wealth and control into monopolies who don't depend on workers](https://youtu.be/jXf04bhcjbg?si=aIOmTenjtq37m9Lp), to [displacing workers](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4071040), to [military uses](https://www.politico.eu/article/robots-coming-ukraine-testing-ground-ai-artificial-intelligence-powered-combat-war-russia/), to [mass survelliance](https://bigdatachina.csis.org/the-ai-surveillance-symbiosis-in-china/#:~:text=With%20regard%20to%20China%2C%20it,data%20acquired%20through%20government%20contracts.) that are being developed in labs with paper quotas and ethics standards like Chenliang's. That pressure to turn out papers by every conference deadline means a lot of research ends up getting farmed out of students before proper thought, care, and consideration to consequences can be given. Many AI research labs currently work like factories, research-paper factories.

### Chenliang - Early Days

#### Evolutionary Learning

2020 [Hospitalization 3](8-Holy-Faith.md#comedic-aside-sexier-moments-during-chenliang-advising) is also literally where I started getting my [evolutionary learning ideas](https://github.com/slerman12/BuildingBlocks/blob/master/Population.py), with attention, which apparently to my surprise [had some positive results](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sw2Iu6foH3dmn-7a2JfijCljqheH_A3fEW5OuK-68Yg/edit?usp=sharing), though I don't even remember doing that. [I just remember having made this video](https://youtu.be/TEKgesBVTJ0?si=OtXQYMZgVd3Qu36M) (all within a pretty short time period after the hospitalization, and at this point Chenliang's group was becoming really impressed with me, and I was starting to build a good reputation, though that would only develop, occassionally me getting side-tracked with some other really good [ideas](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QbWNfnWAgm0rHTy4EFnDrjpaMP7Ako6isNxOUSR17_A/edit?usp=sharing) and/or implementations ([BioNet](https://github.com/slerman12/UnifiedMLold2/tree/master/Blocks/Architectures/LermanBlocks/BioNet), [ViRP](https://github.com/slerman12/UnifiedMLold2/blob/master/Blocks/Architectures/LermanBlocks/ViRP.py), or [Thousand Brains](https://github.com/slerman12/UnifiedMLold2/blob/master/Blocks/Architectures/LermanBlocks/ThousandBrains.py)), mysteriously always side-tracked despite my interest and usually some positive result, until when I was building [UnifiedML](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML-legacy) (to be described [below](#chris-kanan)) — consistently over more than 2 years, finally not side-tracked, er, until I was terminated — they were pretty much in awe of me and I felt reasonably appreciated for the first time for my work). But distracting deep learning revelations aside...

#### Relationships

"Attention is all you need" sounds like a reply to "You just want attention." <!--It’s in bad taste.--> That’s the name of the paper from DeepMind that most revolutionized deep learning after 2017. My later paper under Chenliang was going to be called, ["Relation is all you need,"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QbWNfnWAgm0rHTy4EFnDrjpaMP7Ako6isNxOUSR17_A/edit?usp=sharing) which brings the idea slightly closer to "Relationships are all you need" or John Lennon’s phrasing, "Love is all you need," and the method it uses is more algorithmically democratic (which is a good analogy, since governing systems are systems/algorithms for decision-making, meant to compose the knowlege and wisdom of smaller parts to that of larger collectives, relationally).

I was rushing to make [this](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QbWNfnWAgm0rHTy4EFnDrjpaMP7Ako6isNxOUSR17_A/edit?usp=sharing) into an ECCV, 2022 paper, because Chenliang said it makes him "sad" that almost no one in his group was submitting to ECCV, 2022. Solely out of love, I was about to rush another <!--extremely--> fundamental new MHDPA innovation just because he ended that week's meeting, the week before the submission deadline, with "It makes me sad." I managed to run one experiment in time ([see here for code](https://github.com/slerman12/UnifiedMLold2/blob/master/Blocks/Architectures/LermanBlocks/ViRP.py)), and then resumed my regular work because I still had all of UnifiedML to build, and not even a tacit hint of dissatisfaction from Chenliang.

He was the least-unappreciative of all of the CS faculty of my work, and that became more true than ever with each year he saw my thinking, efficiency, and work ethic, but just as quickly lost sight of that when he remembered my paper count, despite the fact that he was usually tolerant to my submitting fewer papers to conferences compared to his other students, actually, especially as he was pragmatically satisfied by my work under the Mechanical Engineering funding, and as he and the whole Computer Vision lab were largely really impressed and believed in the GATO and JEPA-type UnifiedML framework I was building.

### Second and Third Hair Regrowths<!--, and Third Induced Hair Loss-->

My pubic hair grew back in 2021 while doing a strict steak/salmon-only diet with some Paleo leniency — it was definitely still grown back while I was doing that diet in December, 2021 — and fell out gradually, as the "Paleo" component of my diet, by the modern less-strict "certified" standard, had more intensely included  high-carb "Paleo" snacks, such as those with dark cocoa, coconut, honey, and nut butter type ingredients, nor was my social life exactly resuscitated. 

Regarding social life, the middle-ground, socially, of having improved working conditions<!--that I had--><!--briefly--><!--increasingly during this time-->, as I was getting relatively high enthusiasm from Chenliang and his lab <!--of all Chinese guys--> for my research work (in particular as I progressed with building my [novel UnifiedML AI framework](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML-legacy)), maybe wasn’t <!--sufficient-->as plausible a catalyst for the regrowth as that diet. <!--I get this sounds like the "I once had a black friend" trope, but one of the only people I still trust in my life was in that lab, and like many in that lab was supportive and sincere, but stood out for our shared interests and tastes (in particular when it came to philosophy and TV). I'm not sure whether it's an honor or an insult to give him credit for my pubic hair though, though as it happens he joined the lab slightly after that regrowth and loss, and I will simply give that credit to my diet, unless there are any other takers (maybe avoiding this credit is why everyone rejected me at that time!).--> Amid this, the stress was extremely high, as I had to report updates to two labs every week, presenting results and implementations that had to satisfy Chenliang's pretty strict standards<!-- even as his later-year students, who'd been with him for more than 3 years, let alone 1 and a half years, whose original specializations were Computer Vision in their first 3 years, published in Computer Vision venues more often-->.

My eyelashes started growing back for the first time in summer, 2023, when I'd started doing the steak/salmon-only diet again, and my best friend returned (like [Psyche](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms-V2-in-progress/blob/main/8-Holy-Faith.md#comedic-aside-sexier-moments-during-chenliang-advising), only via text) into my life, and fell out shortly after I was terminated, at which time I also had gone more lenient on my steak/salmon-only diet, due to the combination of more stress (from that termination) and lacking an income. Those three eyelashes that had grown back one by one gradually up to that point, that summer, starting that summer, grew back for the first time ever in the 5 full years since losing all of my hair. Then each fell out, but I attribute them to my best friend, who returned that summer, and probably also the correlating steak/salmon-only diet that I'd resumed before his return, earlier in 2023, after the weather had already gotten warm. Though, besides steak/salmon during that period when my eyelashes started to grow back for the first time, I allowed myself organic tea on that one, as well. Then, when I was terminated by this wonderful university of mine that had cost me my hair in the first place, my newly miracle'd eyelashes fell out suddenly.

However, adding this seems to undermine just how severe the injustice we're talking about is.

The bullies at the University of Rochester's hospital and research institutions don't understand that they botched every action they took in their judgments, treatments, policies, decision-making, and (as will be shown, though hopefully it's apparent already) rulings, and did everything humanly possible, sometimes by blunder rather than on purpose, to take away and waste my dignity, money, social life, physical body, and work.

`I was farmed in a factory, physically maimed/mangled/disfigured, and disposed of.`

### Factory Food

> [!TIP]
> ### High Quality Food in the Medical System
>
> - Inorganic factory-sourced industries, whose practices treat animals inhumanely, in compartments in a factory where they never see the light of day and bloat fat with antibiotics, grains, corn, and soy, can be out-competed by organic sources where the cows can graze and live with other cows on pastures, under the sun, ethically, if medical institutions specifically sourced only and more, as part of their patient care, from the latter, organic highest-end sources. Cows living on a grassy pasture with other cows is not only not inhumane for the cows, but better as a living condition, than what people get from hospital environments.
> - Currently, hospitals provide 4 - 5 types of services: tests, drugs, surgeries, personal care (e.g., helping with walking to the bathroom), therapies. High quality food, is not an insignificant omission. Hospitals and health insurances should pay for high quality food. Doctors should gear more towards making high quality food prescriptions, which should be covered by health insurers, including Medicaid and Medicare. I suggest a specific debit card (can be a voting ID card or other card) given without means-testing that can be used at grocers. Such a card can be the basis of paying for dietary prescriptions that doctors make, meant to pay for specific foods, so that health insurers, including Medicaid and Medicare, cover the costs, as they do with prescription pharmaceuticals. 
> - 2.4 million years of human evolution in the Ice Age, wherein even Africa had winters and some glacial ice, were followed by the last 11,500 years of the modern epoch. I know nutritionists aren't mathematicians, but 2.4 million is a slightly bigger number than 11,500. On principle, though it may not be the standard consensus, the evolution history that produced our biological consciousness and cognition deserves our reverence. My grandma, my grandma's grandma, her grandma's grandma and so on — yes, back into the Ice Age — are all ancestral roots of wisdom, from whose evolutionary conditions were born our metabolism physiologies.
> - I haven't found any hypothetical risks of my trialed diet to be an issue, but that's why latitudinal studies are needed. I ate fresh rather than frozen, grass fed grass-finished organic, almost always wild-caught rather than farmed, with no other interacting chemicals, besides allowing myself salt and black pepper, and water. The idea that red meat causes anything, has not yet had a standard scientific investigation in the context of organic, grass fed, grass-finished, and wild-caught meat, and controlled for for other interactions, e.g., sauces, sugars, and so on.
> - A proper nutrition study that investigates interacting chemicals, requires a combinatorially intractable number of control variables (and in this case, a lot of money, not so much that the medical system can't afford it, and not so much that humanity's health should have to be sacrificed to scrounge on, but more than usual nutrition studies are funded and invest), rarely accounted for in nutrition studies. This inadvertent study, on a population of me (low-socioeconomic family background, limited to a PhD student income of less-than-official-New-York-State-living-wage), longitudinally, resulted in at least 3 measured breakthrough results, across a span of 6 years (since first injected Dupilumab), and other breakthrough-type results harder to measure around energy, mood, cognition, and neurological functioning, besides hair.

### Disciplines I Did

I did everything advised and required, amid and after the 2020 hospitalizations, medical trauma, and between bouts of severe [eczema](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Eczema.md). I exerted unthinkable discipline to stay functional during all times.

Aside from fasting for the sake of my [eczema](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Eczema.md), I did all of the following listed disciplines for at least a year consecutively without interruption concurrently, some of these things for many years. That might sound voluntary, or unreasonable. No, I had to both to do PhD work and to recover from the [Medical Center's severe damages](2-Opposing-views.md). I'm a 5'5" nerdy guy who weighs 110lb and these kinds of disciplines aren't natural to me. Medical leaves aren't paid and I could've lost the subsidization for my student loans and potentially health insurance, and since Henry was leaving, pretty much definitely my PhD. Under Chenliang, the work I had to do to justify what was already cost me was extreme. Those disciplines are the only thing that made it possible to meet the requirements of the program and make progress that is just to me, while literally mutilated, brain damaged, and burning alive, or recovering and regrouping thereafter—regrouping the work and credit that I deserved that was already lost from me. In part, those damages that caused the necessity of these disciplines were induced by the University of Rochester Medical Center's malpractices, while they profited from that Med Center's research (where I also worked concurrently)<!--, big-pharma drug agreements,--> and coercive psychoactive-drug prescriptions<!--/administrations on me-->. The University of Rochester is literally a monopoly, both financially as a Rochester-wide power-center and over the health and thinking of its students<!-- and student workers-->, and in fact, the world.

- Daily yoga in the morning.
- Daily Pranayama in the morning.
- Twice-daily [Transcendental Meditation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Across_the_Universe#Composition), morning and afternoon.
- Daily early morning jogs.
- Daily calisthenics, morning and afternoon.
- Daily Wim Hof method and freezing cold baths in the morning.
- No movies, tv shows, or social media... or even for a long time music.
  - Only reading, usually non-fiction or academic papers, and nature walks.
  - Sometimes singing in nature. My words rhymed on their own. My own music. Personal and supernaturally rich, rhyming rapidly and intelligent, through the phonetics of my voice that I followed and adhered to, obediently.
- Either strict Paleo, strict Paleo-Keto, or organic grassfed grass-finished pasture-raised steak, Himalayan sea salt, and wild-caught salmon only (allowing my hair to grow back). TO DO: Point out how expensive this was on less than a living wage for a student with no financial safety net, a family that immigrated here without money as refugees (including me), and that New York State officially classifies the University of Rochester's salary for PhD students as being below official living wage. Noting again: three times my hair grew back on this diet, and it very noticeably expedited my brain damage recovery, and those were the reasons I had to do it (besides work demand, a friend biasing me more towards recognizing the dietary value, and Mikhaila Peterson recommendation).
  - No other foods, or drinks besides water.
- Daily walks in parks and on trails.
- Camping regularly, sometimes with just sleeping bag and no tent.
- Desperate attempts to still socialize every week, usually via [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com).
- Linguistic adherence.
- 70-hour work weeks on average, always across two labs, including usually ones where I did essentially the job of a software engineer, minus the pay.
- Reading the Torah for the first time every day, no commentary, raw Biblical text.
- After the benzo brain damage but before the year(s) when I did all that, prolonged fasting (8 days and ~15 days, respectively, in that time period at least) and intermittent fasting (16:8, for maybe about one consecutive month) as trials (prolonged fasting gets rid of my [eczema](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Eczema.md); intermittent fasting hasn't seriously helped me), as well as prolonged fasts for religious observances such as Yom Kippur. 

<!--Also, just look at my GitHubs and GitHub repositories and commit counts and even chronologies and time stamps if you really want to investigate the extent of my discipline, particularly November, 2021 - September, 2023, during which I maintained all of these disciplines without even a single day's slip. However, I largely maintained all of them throughout the course of my PhD, initially Paleo diet and asceticisms and meditation routine, and then the stricter versions and the other disciplines for recovering from the Medical Center-induced damages. -->
No medical leaves, breaks from these routines. Anything else, I get pressure from the PhD, no chance of recovery from the alopecia, potentially [eczema](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Eczema.md), and the PTSD-hellfire from the more-than-year of benzo-brain damage minus recovery of mood and cognition owed to these disciplines.
