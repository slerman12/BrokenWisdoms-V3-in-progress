# Part 1

## <!--<sub>ðŸ”Ž</sub>--> Background

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The PhD student handbook has **only one clause of accountability** for the grad school, and it's to specify what the PhD student would need to do (without pay or support) for reinstatement:
> - in writing
> - when support is withdrawn

- The only time reinstatement was mentioned was by Michael [on **10/31/2024**](3-Disproof.md#email-10312023). No details were given how, on what conditions, and whether any advisor or source of income would be provided, and if not, how to go about obtaining those without any further connections or resources to do so. Having emailed the individual faculty members who might have served as replacements, and met with one and suggested another to the department, there wasn't a path (and none of these things were suggested by the faculty, nor in writing).
- I replied to that reinstatement-mentioning email when it was sent on **10/31/2024**, that is, on my last day of being an employed PhD student, [asking for evidence for the termination reasons](3-Disproof.md#hypocrisy) and my reply was ignored. It was the last message sent between us, prior to [one more](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/7-Ongoing.md) above that I resumed also currently being ignored. In the [latter](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/7-Ongoing.md) (the latest of the ignored), I brought up that the reinstatement-condition wasn't indicated to me.
- In that reinstatement-mentioning email that Michael ignored my replies to, Michael had reached out to meet in person, but that wouldn't suffice for reinstatement nor secure my future as an employee with a salary, advisor, and a basic standard of living. The reason for wanting to meet was "mutual understanding." The reinstatement-clause explicitly specifies "in writing."
  - It's taking me a year to write this book. "Mutual understanding" requires at least a book's-worth of traumatic context, that according to Michael, would somehow be better conveyable off-the-record via a meeting while I had no salary or income to an authority in a threatening position, who ignored my replies, hid away from my emailed questions, and disrespected me via a sudden termination email (the Termination Slam) on **10/12/2024** immediately following sending him my sincere research proposal that his previous email specified as the condition for staying in the program (<!--conflating the-->of <!--in addition to--> research that I'd already done, and according to two PIs and former advisor was ready to defend)... and the idea of "proposing" a research "plan" in one's 6th year â€” already having done the substance of the PhD â€” is ridiculous, not to mention my advisor's only caveat to graduation that month being that I follow his formatting instructions, ridiculous in itself since I hadn't started writing the thesis yet. Michael didn't approve my plan due to contradictory opinions from a brand new interim committee, despite everything that was communicated and verified to him by email, such as my advisor's opinion that I was ready to defend, the confirmation that my advisor was leaving (second advisor to do so, and again for no particular reason), Chris Kanan's forgetting of details about the meeting ("[Deus Ex Memory](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Deus-Ex-Memory.md)"), and all of the [aforementioned trauma](2-Opposing-views.md) condensed as much as I could've, communicated and re-visited for him/them elaborately in writing, and doing so in the mid of another trauma, *being terminated*, being inflicted *by him* as the context grounds for that communicating and revisiting of trauma, which I managed to do for him in writing.
- I responded to Michael about meeting in person on **10/25/2024**: (1) "Hi Michael, Iâ€™d be willing to meet. But please extend my stipend through November," and (2) "I would be glad to meet in person, but I ask that you restore my stipend for the month of November. Thank you." November is my birthday actually.
  - To establish "in person" instead of "in writing" as having been an "implicitly" indicated reinstatement-condition requires rephrasing the reinstatement-clause, foregoing explicit formal communications, and violating ethics by demanding that I participate in an unpaid face-to-face, *off-the-record*, meeting with an authority actively inflicting trauma who has no background or expertise in my field, who has no power to address the issues preventing my reinstatement (e.g. lack of advisor), as the only imaginable grounds for hypothetical reinstatement after a disrespectful, unjustified, un-evidenced termination.
- Support, as distinct from pay, was withdrawn long before Michael or any faculty mentioned reinstatement.
  - As evidenced by my second advisor's communication of withdrawal and reallocation of funding on **07/24/2024**, the sudden termination email on **10/12/2024**, and [many tortures](2-Opposing-views.md), including permanent or ongoing ones, inflicted by Michael's institution. To reiterate, all I asked for in the research proposal that Michael slammed with a termination, was the means for peace to write my thesis. That detail was the only part he specified in a later email as having an issue with.
- Note also: the University of Rochester's CS department doesn't have dedicated PhD reinstatement applications. Any appearance of that reinstatement-mentioning email of **10/31/2024** as indicating a reinstatement-condition is gaslighting. The referent of what is mentioned is reinstatement, not a reinstatement-condition. Even if that weren't the case, "in writing" cannot be relegated as "in person" (and also thereby "off the record")<!-- unless the indicated reinstatement-condition can redefine the clause from which it's necessitated, but the PhD student handbook isn't a rewritable Turing tape (at least not ad lib), making that absurd to such a point that asserting it becomes gaslighting-->.

## Definitions

### (1) Necessity of support set.

Define the set of "what is necessary for reinstatement of support, indicated to the student by the faculty, in writing, when support is withdrawn" as the variable $x$.

$x$ $\coloneqq$ $\emptyset$.

That is the empty set, as described in the <!--$\color{#7B52D7} \textbf{&#9432;}$--> [Background](#background). 

## Propositions

### (1) Goodness, truth, and sufficiency.

Suppose some reasons they had for terminating me were good, true, or sufficient. ([False](../2-Opposing-Views/8.2-PhD-Faculty-Malpractices.md), but assume true).

### (2) Student's negligence.

Suppose I didnâ€™t do something they suggested, requested, or required of me, that I didn't notify in advance I couldn't with good cause. ([False](../2-Opposing-Views/8.2-PhD-Faculty-Malpractices.md#does-no-no-mean-no) and [doubly false](../2-Opposing-Views/8.2-PhD-Faculty-Malpractices.md#novel-reinforcement-learning-systems-algorithm-suggestion), but assume true).

### (3) PhD student handbook.

"When withdrawing support, the faculty will indicate to the student, in writing, what is necessary for reinstatement of support." - PhD student handbook, page 15. Mathematically:

$\vert x \vert > 0$.

## Disproofs

## Proposition 3. 

$\vert x \vert > 0$.

**Disproof.**

$x = \emptyset$. &nbsp; (Definition 1) 

$\rightarrow |x| = 0$ 

$\quad \quad \ \ \not> 0$. &nbsp; $\square$

Their alleged reason for terminating me was that I violated <!--a policy in--> the PhD student handbook. Here is a proof, derived mathematically, that they have violated and are currently violating <!--a policy in--> the PhD student handbook. Of course, whether I did, is still a question, since I notified the faculty well in advance with extremely good cause that I wouldn't attend the make-up review and they didn't disapprove.
